  <p><font face="Times New Roman">....</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">H</font><font face="Times New Roman">aving been
  given leave by the Blessed One, Sakka the deva-king asked him his first question:
  &quot;Fettered with what, dear sir -- though they think, 'May we live free from hostility,
  free from violence, free from rivalry, free from ill will, free from those who are
  hostile' -- do devas, human beings, asuras, nagas, gandhabbas, and whatever other many
  kinds of beings there are, nevertheless live in hostility, violence, rivalry, ill will,
  with those who are hostile?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus Sakka asked his first question of the Blessed One,
  and the Blessed One, when asked, replied: &quot;Devas, human beings, asuras, nagas,
  gandhabbas, and whatever other many kinds of beings there are, are fettered with envy and
  stinginess, which is why -- even though they think, 'May we live free from hostility, free
  from violence, free from rivalry, free from ill will, free from those who are hostile --
  they nevertheless live in hostility, violence, rivalry, ill will, with those who are
  hostile.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the Blessed One answered, having been asked by Sakka
  the deva-king. Gratified, Sakka was delighted in and expressed his approval of the Blessed
  One's words: &quot;So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Hearing the Blessed
  One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is overcome.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Sakka, having delighted in and expressed his approval
  of the Blessed One's words, asked him a further question: &quot;But what, dear sir, is the
  cause of envy and stinginess, what is their origination, what gives them birth, what is
  their source? When what exists do they come into being? When what doesn't exist do they
  not?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Envy and stinginess have dear-and-not-dear as their
  cause, have dear-and-not-dear as their origination, have dear-and-not-dear as what gives
  them birth, have dear-and-not-dear as their source. When dear-and-not-dear exist, they
  come into being. When dear-and-not-dear are not, they don't.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But what, dear sir, is the cause of
  dear-and-not-dear, what is their origination, what gives them birth, what is their source?
  When what exists do they come into being? When what doesn't exist do they not?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Dear-and-not-dear have desire as their cause, have
  desire as their origination, have desire as what gives them birth, have desire as their
  source. When desire exists, they come into being. When desire is not, they don't.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But what, dear sir, is the cause of desire, what is
  its origination, what gives it birth, what is its source? When what exists does it come
  into being? When what doesn't exist does it not?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Desire has thinking as its cause, has thinking as
  its origination, has thinking as what gives it birth, has thinking as its source. When
  thinking exists, desire comes into being. When thinking is not, it doesn't.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But what, dear sir, is the cause of thinking, what
  is its origination, what gives it birth, what is its source? When what exists does it come
  into being? When what doesn't exist does it not?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thinking has the perceptions and categories of
  complication[<a HREF="#n1" NAME="1">1</a>] as its cause, has the perceptions and
  categories of complication as its origination, has the perceptions and categories of
  complication as what gives it birth, has the perceptions and categories of complication as
  its source. When the perceptions and categories of complication exists, thinking comes
  into being. When the perceptions and categories of complication are not, it doesn't.&quot;
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And how has he practiced, dear sir: the monk who has
  practiced the practice leading to the right cessation of the perceptions and categories of
  complication?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Joy is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be
  pursued and not to be pursued. Grief is of two sorts: to be pursued and not to be pursued.
  Equanimity is of two sorts: to be pursued and not to be pursued. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'Joy is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be
  pursued and not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to what was it said?
  When one knows of a feeling of joy, 'As I pursue this joy, unskillful mental qualities
  increase, and skillful mental qualities decline,' that sort of joy is not to be pursued.
  When one knows of a feeling of joy, 'As I pursue this joy, unskillful mental qualities
  decline, and skillful mental qualities increase,' that sort of joy is to be pursued. And
  this sort of joy may be accompanied by directed thought and evaluation or free of directed
  thought and evaluation. Of the two, the latter is the more refined. 'Joy is of two sorts,
  I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued and not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in
  reference to this was it said. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'Grief is of two sorts, I tell you: to be pursued
  and not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to what was it said? When one

  is the more refined. 'Equanimity is of two sorts, I tell you: to be pursued and not to be

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This is how he has practiced, deva-king: the monk

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Sakka, having delighted in and expressed his approval
  of the Blessed One's words, asked him a further question: &quot;But how has he practiced,
  dear sir: the monk who has practiced for restraint in the Patimokkha?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Bodily conduct is of two sorts, I tell you,
  deva-king: to be pursued and not to be pursued. Verbal conduct is of two sorts: to be
  pursued and not to be pursued. Searching is of two sorts: to be pursued and not to be
  pursued. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'Bodily conduct is of two sorts, I tell you,
  deva-king: to be pursued and not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to
  what was it said? When one knows of bodily conduct, 'As I pursue this bodily conduct,

  'Searching is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued and not to be pursued.'
  Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This is how has he practiced, deva-king: the monk
  who has practiced the practice for restraint in the Patimokkha.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the Blessed One answered, having been asked by Sakka
  the deva-king. Gratified, Sakka was delighted in and expressed his approval of the Blessed
  One's words: &quot;So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Hearing the Blessed
  One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is overcome.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Sakka, having delighted in and expressed his approval
  of the Blessed One's words, asked him a further question: &quot;But how has he practiced,
  dear sir: the monk who has practiced for restraint with regard to the sense
  faculties?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Forms cognizable by the eye are of two sorts, I tell
  you, deva-king: to be pursued and not to be pursued. Sounds cognizable by the ear ....
  Aromas cognizable by the nose .... Flavors cognizable by the tongue .... Tactile
  sensations cognizable by the body .... Ideas cognizable by the intellect are of two sorts:
  to be pursued and not to be pursued.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this was said, Sakka the deva-king said to the
  Blessed One, &quot;Dear sir, I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief
  statement. If, as one pursues a certain type of form cognizable by the eye, unskillful
  mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, that sort of form
  cognizable by the eye is not to be pursued. But if, as one pursues a certain type of form
  cognizable by the eye, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities
  increase, that sort of form cognizable by the eye is to be pursued. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If, as one pursues a certain type of sound
  cognizable by the ear .... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If, as one pursues a certain type of aroma
  cognizable by the nose .... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If, as one pursues a certain type of flavor
  cognizable by the tongue .... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If, as one pursues a certain type of tactile
  sensation cognizable by the body .... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If, as one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable
  by the intellect, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities
  decline, that sort of idea cognizable by the intellect is not to be pursued. But if, as
  one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect, unskillful mental
  qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase, that sort of idea cognizable by
  the intellect is to be pursued. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the
  Blessed One's brief statement. Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt
  is now cut off, my perplexity is overcome.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Sakka, having delighted in and expressed his approval
  of the Blessed One's words, asked him a further question: &quot;Dear sir, do all priests
  and contemplatives teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same
  thing, aim at the same goal?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, deva-king, not all priests and contemplatives
  teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the
  same goal.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why, dear sir, don't all priests and contemplatives
  teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the
  same goal?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The world is made up of many properties, various
  properties. Because of the many and various properties in the world, then whichever
  property living beings get fixated on, they become entrenched and latch onto it, saying,
  'Only this is true; anything else is worthless.' This is why not all priests and
  contemplatives teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same
  thing, aim at the same goal.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But, dear sir, are all priests and contemplatives
  utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly
  consummate?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, deva-king, not all priests and contemplatives
  are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly
  consummate.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But why, dear sir, are not all priests and
  contemplatives utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy
  life, utterly consummate?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Those monks who are released through the total
  ending of craving are the ones who are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds,
  followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate. This is why not all priests and
  contemplatives are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly
  holy life, utterly consummate.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the Blessed One answered, having been asked by Sakka
  the deva-king. Gratified, Sakka was delighted in and expressed his approval of the Blessed
  One's words: &quot;So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Hearing the Blessed
  One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is overcome.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Sakka, having delighted in and expressed his approval
  of the Blessed One's words, said to him: &quot;Obsession is a disease, obsession is a
  boil, obsession is an arrow. It seduces one, drawing one into this or that state of being,
  which is why one is reborn in high states and low. Whereas other outside priests and
  contemplatives gave me no chance to ask them these questions, the Blessed One has answered
  at length, so that he has removed the arrow of my uncertainty and perplexity.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Deva-king, do you recall having asked other priests
  and contemplatives these questions?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, lord, I recall having asked other priests and
  contemplatives these questions.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If it's no inconvenience, could you tell me how they
  answered?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It's no inconvenience when sitting with the Blessed
  One or one who is like him.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then tell me, deva-king.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Having gone to those whom I considered to be priests
  and contemplatives living in isolated dwellings in the wilderness, I asked them these
  questions. But when asked by me, they were at a loss. Being at a loss, they asked <i>me</i>
  in return, 'What is your name?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Being asked, I responded, 'I, dear sir, am Sakka,
  the deva-king.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So they questioned me further, 'But what kamma did
  you do to attain to this state?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So I taught them the Dhamma as far as I had heard
  and mastered it. And they were gratified with just this much: 'We have seen Sakka, the
  deva-king, and he has answered our questions!' So, instead of my becoming their disciple,
  they simply became mine. But I, lord, am the Blessed One's disciple, a stream-winner,
  steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Deva-king, do you recall ever having previously
  experienced such happiness and joy?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, lord, I do.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And how do you recall ever having previously
  experienced such happiness and joy?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Once, lord, the devas and asuras were arrayed in
  battle. And in that battle the devas won, while the asuras lost. Having won the battle, as
  the victor in the battle, this thought occurred to me: 'Whatever has been the divine
  nourishment of the asuras, whatever has been the divine nourishment of the devas, the
  devas will now enjoy both of them.' But my attainment of happiness and joy of mine was in
  the sphere of violence and weapons. It didn't lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to
  cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge to self-awakening, to Unbinding. But my attainment
  of happiness and joy on hearing the Blessed One's Dhamma is in the sphere of no violence,
  the sphere of no weapons. It leads to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to
  calm, to direct knowledge to self-awakening, to Unbinding.&quot; .... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Sakka, the deva-king, touched the earth with his hand
  and said three times, &quot;Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly
  Self-awakened One! Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly Self-awakened
  One! Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly Self-awakened One!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">While this explanation was being given, there arose to
  Sakka the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye -- &quot;Whatever is subject to origination is
  all subject to cessation&quot; -- as it also did to [his following of] 80,000 other devas.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such were the questions that the Blessed One answered at
  Sakka's bidding. And so this discourse is called &quot;Sakka's Questions.&quot; </font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><a NAME="n1">1</a>.</b> Complication = <i>papa&ntilde;ca.</i>
  The tendency of the mind to proliferate issues from the sense of &quot;self.&quot; This
  term can also be translated as self-reflexive thinking, reification, falsification,
  distortion, elaboration, or exaggeration. In the discourses, it is frequently used in
  analyses of the psychology of conflict. The categories of complexity stem from the
  self-reflexive thought, &quot;I am the thinker,&quot; (see Sn IV.14), and include the
  categories of inappropriate attention (see MN 2): being/not-being, me/not-me,
  mine/not-mine, doer/done-to. The perceptions of complexity include such thoughts as
  &quot;This is me. This is mine. This is my self.&quot; These perceptions and categories
  turn back on the person who allows them to proliferate, giving rise to internal conflict
  and strife, which then expand outward. For more on these terms, see MN 18. <!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<a HREF="#1">Go
