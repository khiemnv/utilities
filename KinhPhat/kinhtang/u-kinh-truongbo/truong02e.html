  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse is one of the masterpieces of the Pali
    Canon. At heart, it is a comprehensive portrait of the Buddhist path of training,
    illustrating each stage of the training with vivid similes. This portrait is placed in
    juxtaposition to the Buddhist view of the teachings of rival philosophical teachers of the
    time, showing how the Buddha -- in contradistinction to the inflexible, party-line
    approach of his contemporaries -- presented his teaching in a way that was pertinent and
    sensitive to the needs of his listeners. This larger portrait of the intellectual
    landscape of early Budhist India is then presented in a moving narrative frame: the sad
    story of King Ajatasattu. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ajatasattu was the son of King Bimbisara of Magadha, one
    of the Buddha's earliest followers. Urged on by Devadatta -- the Buddha's cousin, who
    wished to use Ajatasattu's support in his bid to take over the Buddha's position as head
    of the Sangha -- Ajatasattu arranged for his father's death so that he could secure his
    own position on the throne. As a result of this evil deed, he was destined not only to be
    killed by his own son -- Udayibhadda (mentioned in the discourse) -- but also to take
    immediate rebirth in one of the lowest regions of hell. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this discourse, Ajatasattu visits the Buddha in hopes
    that the latter will bring some peace to his mind. The question he puts to the Buddha
    shows the limited level of his own understanding, so the Buddha patiently describes the
    steps of the training, beginning at a very basic level and gradually moving up, as a way
    of raising the king's spiritual horizons. At the end of the talk, Ajatasattu takes refuge
    in the Triple Gem. Although his earlier deeds were so heavy that this expression of faith
    could have only limited consequences in the immediate present, the Commentary assures us
    that the king's story would ultimately have a happy ending. After the Buddha's death, he
    sponsored the First Council, at which a congress of arahant disciples produced the first
    standardized account of the Buddha's teachings. As a result of the merit coming from this
    deed, Ajatasattu is destined -- after his release from hell -- to attain Awakening as a
    Private Buddha. </font></p>

  <hr width="25%" align="center">
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">I</font><font face="Times New Roman"> have heard
  that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Rajagaha, in Jivaka Komarabhacca's
  mango grove, with a large community of monks -- 1,250 monks in all. Now at that time -- it
  being the observance day, the full-moon night of the water-lily season, the fourth month
  of the rains -- King Ajatasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Videha, was sitting on the
  roof terrace of his palace surround by his ministers. Then he felt inspired to exclaim:
  &quot;How wonderful is this moonlit night! How beautiful...How lovely...How
  inspiring...How auspicious is this moonlit night! What priest or contemplative should we
  visit tonight who might enlighten and bring peace to our mind?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this was said, one of the ministers said to the king:
  &quot;Your majesty, there is Purana Kassapa, the leader of a community, the leader of a
  group, the teacher of a group, honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass of people.
  He is aged, long gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life. Your majesty
  should visit him. Perhaps, if you visited him, he would enlighten and bring peace to your
  mind.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this was said, the king remained silent. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then another minister said to the king: &quot;Your
  majesty, there is Makkhali Gosala...&quot; ...&quot;Your majesty, there is Ajita
  Kesakambala...&quot; ...&quot;Your majesty, there is Pakudha Kaccayana...&quot;
  ...&quot;Your majesty, there is Sa&ntilde;jaya Belatthaputta...&quot; ...&quot;Your majesty,
  there is Nigantha Nataputta, the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher
  of a group, honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass of people. He is aged, long
  gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life. Your majesty should visit him.
  Perhaps, if you visited him, he would enlighten and bring peace to your mind.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this was said, the king remained silent. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">All this time Jivaka Komarabhacca was sitting silently not
  far from the king. So the king said to him, &quot;Friend Jivaka, why are you silent?&quot;
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Your majesty, there is the Blessed One, worthy and
  rightly self-awakened, staying in my mango grove with a large community of monks -- 1,250
  monks in all. Concerning this Blessed One, this admirable report has been spread: 'Surely,
  the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear knowing and
  conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of tamable
  people, teacher of beings human and divine, awakened, blessed.' Your majesty should visit
  him. Perhaps, if you visited him, he would enlighten and bring peace to your mind.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then in that case, friend Jivaka, have the riding
  elephants prepared.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having replied, &quot;As you say, your majesty,&quot;
  having had five hundred female elephants prepared as well as the king's personal tusker,
  Jivaka announced to the king: &quot;Your majesty, your riding elephants are prepared. Do
  what you think it is now time to do.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the king, having had five hundred of his women
  mounted on the five hundred female elephants -- one on each -- and having mounted his own
  personal tusker, set out from the capital in full royal state, with attendants carrying
  torches, headed for Jivaka Komarabhacca's mango grove. But when the king was not far from
  the mango grove, he was gripped with fear, trepidation, his hair standing on end. Fearful,
  agitated, his hair standing on end, he said to Jivaka Komarabhacca: &quot;Friend Jivaka,
  you aren't deceiving me, are you? You aren't betraying me, are you? You aren't turning me
  over to my enemies, are you? How can there be such a large community of monks -- 1,250 in
  all -- with no sound of sneezing, no sound of coughing, no voices at all?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Don't be afraid, great king. Don't be afraid. I'm
  not deceiving you or betraying you or turning you over to your enemies. Go forward, great
  king, go forward! Those are lamps burning in the pavilion hall.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the king, going as far on his tusker as the ground
  would permit, dismounted and approached the door of the pavilion on foot. On arrival, he
  asked Jivaka: &quot;Where, friend Jivaka, is the Blessed One?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;That is the Blessed One, great king, sitting against
  the middle pillar, facing east, surrounded by the community of monks.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the king approached the Blessed One and, on reaching
  him, stood to one side. As he was standing there -- surveying the community of monks
  sitting in absolute silence, as calm as a lake -- he felt inspired to exclaim: &quot;May
  my son, Prince Udayibhadda, enjoy the same peace that this community of monks now
  enjoys!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">[The Blessed One said:] &quot;Have you come, great king,
  together with your affections?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Venerable sir, my son, Prince Udayibhadda, is very
  dear to me. May he enjoy the same peace that this community of monks now enjoys!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, bowing down to the Blessed One, and saluting the
  community of monks with his hands palm-to-palm over his heart, he sat to one side. As he
  was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: &quot;I would like to ask the Blessed One
  about a certain issue, if he would give me the opportunity to explain my question.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ask, great king, whatever you like.&quot; </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The King's Question)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Venerable sir, there are these common craftsmen:
  elephant-trainers, horse-trainers, charioteers, archers, standard bearers, camp marshals,
  supply corps officers, high royal officers, commandos, military heroes, armor-clad
  warriors, leather-clad warriors, domestic slaves, confectioners, barbers, bath attendants,
  cooks, garland-makers, laundrymen, weavers, basket-makers, potters, calculators,
  accountants, and any other craftsmen of a similar sort. They live off the fruits of their
  crafts, visible in the here and now. They give happiness and pleasure to themselves, to
  their parents, wives, and children, to their friends and colleagues. They put in place an
  excellent presentation of offerings to priests and contemplatives, leading to heaven,
  resulting in happiness, conducive to a heavenly rebirth. Is it possible, venerable sir, to
  point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Do you remember, great king, ever having asked this
  question of other priests and contemplatives?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, I do.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If it isn't troublesome for you, how did they
  answer?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, it's not troublesome for me wherever the Blessed
  One -- or someone like the Blessed One -- is sitting.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then speak, great king.&quot; </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Non-action)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Once, venerable sir, I approached Purana Kassapa
  and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly
  greetings and courtesies, I sat down to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him:
  'Venerable Kassapa, there are these common craftsmen...They live off the fruits of their
  crafts, visible in the here and now...Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a
  similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in there here and now?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When this was said, Purana Kassapa said to me,
  'Great king, in acting or getting others to act, in mutilating or getting others to
  mutilate, in torturing or getting others to torture, in inflicting sorrow or in getting
  others to inflict sorrow, in tormenting or getting others to torment, in intimidating or
  getting others to intimidate, in taking life, taking what is not given, breaking into
  houses, plundering wealth, committing burglary, ambushing highways, committing adultery,
  speaking falsehood -- one does no evil. If with a razor-edged disk one were to turn all
  the living beings on this earth to a single heap of flesh, a single pile of flesh, there
  would be no evil from that cause, no coming of evil. Even if one were to go along the
  right bank of the Ganges, killing and getting others to kill, mutilating and getting
  others to mutilate, torturing and getting others to torture, there would be no evil from
  that cause, no coming of evil. Even if one were to go along the left bank of the Ganges,
  killing and getting others to kill, mutilating and getting others to mutilate, torturing
  and getting others to torture, there would be no evil from that cause, no coming of evil.
  Through generosity, self-control, restraint, and truthful speech there is no merit from
  that cause, no coming of merit.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative
  life, visible here and now, Purana Kassapa answered with non-action. Just as if a person,
  when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a
  breadfruit, were to answer with a mango: In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible here and now, Purana Kassapa answered with non-action. The
  thought occurred to me: 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a priest or
  contemplative living in his realm?' Yet I neither delighted in Purana Kassapa's words nor
  did I protest against them. Neither delighting nor protesting, I was dissatisfied. Without
  expressing dissatisfaction, without accepting his teaching, without adopting it, I got up
  from my seat and left.</font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Purification through Wandering-on)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Another time I approached Makkhali Gosala and, on
  arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings
  and courtesies, I sat down to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him: 'Venerable
  Gosala, there are these common craftsmen...They live off the fruits of their crafts,
  visible in the here and now...Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit
  of the contemplative life, visible in there here and now?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When this was said, Makkhali Gosala said to me,
  'Great king, there is no cause, no requisite condition, for the defilement of beings.
  Beings are defiled without cause, without requisite condition. There is no cause, no
  requisite condition, for the purification of beings. Beings are purified without cause,
  without requisite condition. There is nothing self-caused, nothing other-caused, nothing
  human-caused. There is no strength, no effort, no human energy, no human endeavor. All
  living beings, all life, all beings, all souls are powerless, devoid of strength, devoid
  of effort. Subject to the changes of fate, serendipity, and nature, they are sensitive to
  pleasure and pain in the six great classes of birth. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'There are 1,406,600 principle modes of origin.
  There are 500 kinds of kamma, five kinds, and three kinds; full kamma and half kamma.
  There are 62 pathways, 62 sub-eons, six great classes of birth, eight classes of men,
  4,900 modes of livelihood, 4,900 kinds of wanderers, 4,900 Naga-abodes, 2,000 faculties,
  3,000 hells, 36 dust-realms, seven spheres of percipient beings, seven spheres of
  non-percipient beings, seven kinds of jointed plants, seven kinds of deities, seven kinds
  of human beings, seven kinds of demons, seven great lakes, seven major knots, seven minor
  knots, 700 major precipices, 700 minor precipices, 700 major dreams, 700 minor dreams,
  84,000 great aeons. Having transmigrated and wandered on through these, the wise and the
  foolish alike will put an end to pain. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'Though one might think, &quot;Through this
  morality, this practice, this austerity, or this holy life I will ripen unripened kamma
  and eliminate ripened kamma whenever touched by it&quot; -- that is impossible. Pleasure
  and pain are measured out, the wandering-on is fixed in its limits. There is no shortening
  or lengthening, no accelerating or decelerating. Just as a ball of string, when thrown,
  comes to its end simply by unwinding, in the same way, having transmigrated and wandered
  on, the wise and the foolish alike will put an end to pain.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative
  life, visible here and now, Makkhali Gosala answered with purification through
  wandering-on. Just as if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a
  breadfruit; or, when asked about a breadfruit, were to answer with a mango. In the same
  way, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Makkhali
  Gosala answered with purification through wandering-on. The thought occurred to me: 'How
  can anyone like me think of disparaging a priest or contemplative living in his realm?'
  Yet I neither delighted in Makkhali Gosala's words nor did I protest against them. Neither
  delighting nor protesting, I was dissatisfied. Without expressing dissatisfaction, without
  accepting his teaching, without adopting it, I got up from my seat and left. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Annihilation)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Another time I approached Ajita Kesakambala and, on
  arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings
  and courtesies, I sat down to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him: 'Venerable
  Ajita, there are these common craftsmen...They live off the fruits of their crafts,
  visible in the here and now...Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit
  of the contemplative life, visible in there here and now?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When this was said, Ajita Kesakambala said to me,
  'Great king, there is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed. There is no
  fruit or result of good or bad actions. There is no this world, no next world, no mother,
  no father, no spontaneously reborn beings; no priests or contemplatives who, faring
  rightly and practicing rightly, proclaim this world and the next after having directly
  known and realized it for themselves. A person is a composite of four primary elements. At
  death, the earth (in the body) returns to and merges with the (external) earth-substance.
  The fire returns to and merges with the external fire-substance. The liquid returns to and
  merges with the external liquid-substance. The wind returns to and merges with the
  external wind-substance. The sense-faculties scatter into space. Four men, with the bier
  as the fifth, carry the corpse. Its eulogies are sounded only as far as the charnel
  ground. The bones turn pigeon-colored. The offerings end in ashes. Generosity is taught by
  idiots. The words of those who speak of existence after death are false, empty chatter.
  With the break-up of the body, the wise and the foolish alike are annihilated, destroyed.
  They do not exist after death.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative
  life, visible here and now, Ajita Kesakambala answered with annihilation. Just as if a
  person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a
  breadfruit, were to answer with a mango. In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible here and now, Ajita Kesakambala answered with annihilation.
  The thought occurred to me: 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a priest or
  contemplative living in his realm?' Yet I neither delighted in Ajita Kesakambala's words
  nor did I protest against them. Neither delighting nor protesting, I was dissatisfied.
  Without expressing dissatisfaction, without accepting his teaching, without adopting it, I
  got up from my seat and left. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Non-relatedness)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Another time I approached Pakudha Kaccayana and, on
  arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings
  and courtesies, I sat down to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him: 'Venerable
  Kaccayana, there are these common craftsmen...They live off the fruits of their crafts,
  visible in the here and now...Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit
  of the contemplative life, visible in there here and now?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When this was said, Pakudha Kaccayana said to me,
  'Great king, there are these seven substances -- unmade, irreducible, uncreated, without a
  creator, barren, stable as a mountain-peak, standing firm like a pillar -- that do not
  alter, do not change, do not interfere with one another, are incapable of causing one
  another pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain. Which seven? The earth-substance, the
  liquid-substance, the fire-substance, the wind-substance, pleasure, pain, and the soul as
  the seventh. These are the seven substances -- unmade, irreducible, uncreated, without a
  creator, barren, stable as a mountain-peak, standing firm like a pillar -- that do not
  alter, do not change, do not interfere with one another, and are incapable of causing one
  another pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'And among them there is no killer nor one who
  causes killing, no hearer nor one who causes hearing, no cognizer nor one who causes
  cognition. When one cuts off [another person's] head, there is no one taking anyone's
  life. It is simply between the seven substances that the sword passes.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative
  life, visible here and now, Pakudha Kaccayana answered with non-relatedness. Just as if a
  person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a
  breadfruit, were to answer with a mango. In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible here and now, Pakudha Kaccayana answered with non-relatedness.
  The thought occurred to me: 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a priest or
  contemplative living in his realm?' Yet I neither delighted in Pakudha Kaccayana's words
  nor did I protest against them. Neither delighting nor protesting, I was dissatisfied.
  Without expressing dissatisfaction, without accepting his teaching, without adopting it, I
  got up from my seat and left. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Fourfold Restraint)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Another time I approached Nigantha Nataputta and, on
  arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings
  and courtesies, I sat down to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him: 'Venerable
  Aggivessana, there are these common craftsmen...They live off the fruits of their crafts,
  visible in the here and now...Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit
  of the contemplative life, visible in there here and now?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When this was said, Nigantha Nataputta said to me,
  'Great king, there is the case where the Nigantha -- the knotless one -- is restrained
  with the fourfold restraint. And how is the Nigantha restrained with the fourfold
  restraint? There is the case where the Nigantha is obstructed by all waters, conjoined
  with all waters, cleansed with all waters, suffused with all waters. This is how the
  Nigantha is restrained with the fourfold restraint. When the Nigantha -- a knotless one --
  is restrained with such a fourfold restraint, he is said to be a Knotless One (Nigantha),
  a son of Nata (Nataputta), with his self perfected, his self controlled, his self
  established.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative
  life, visible here and now, Nigantha Nataputta answered with fourfold restraint. Just as
  if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked
  about a breadfruit, were to answer with a mango: In the same way, when asked about a fruit
  of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Nigantha Nataputta answered with fourfold
  restraint. The thought occurred to me: 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a
  priest or contemplative living in his realm?' Yet I neither delighted in Nigantha
  Nataputta's words nor did I protest against them. Neither delighting nor protesting, I was
  dissatisfied. Without expressing dissatisfaction, without accepting his teaching, without
  adopting it, I got up from my seat and left. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Evasion)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Another time I approached Sa&ntilde;jaya Belatthaputta
  and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly
  greetings and courtesies, I sat down to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him:
  'Venerable Sa&ntilde;jaya, there are these common craftsmen...They live off the fruits of their
  crafts, visible in the here and now...Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a
  similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in there here and now?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When this was said, Sa&ntilde;jaya Belatthaputta said to
  me, 'If you ask me if there exists another world [after death], if I thought that there
  exists another world, would I declare that to you? I don't think so. I don't think in that
  way. I don't think otherwise. I don't think not. I don't think not not. If you asked me if
  there isn't another world...both is and isn't...neither is nor isn't...if there are beings
  who transmigrate...if there aren't...both are and aren't...neither are nor aren't...if the
  Tathagata exists after death...doesn't...both...neither exists nor exists after death,
  would I declare that to you? I don't think so. I don't think in that way. I don't think
  otherwise. I don't think not. I don't think not not.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative
  life, visible here and now, Sa&ntilde;jaya Belatthaputta answered with evasion. Just as if a
  person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a
  breadfruit, were to answer with a mango: In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible here and now, Sa&ntilde;jaya Belatthaputta answered with evasion.
  The thought occurred to me: 'This -- among these priests and contemplatives -- is the most
  foolish and confused of all. How can he, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative
  life, visible here and now, answer with evasion?' Still the thought occurred to me: 'How
  can anyone like me think of disparaging a priest or contemplative living in his realm?'
  Yet I neither delighted in Sa&ntilde;jaya Belatthaputta's words nor did I protest against them.
  Neither delighting nor protesting, I was dissatisfied. Without expressing dissatisfaction,
  without accepting his teaching, without adopting it, I got up from my seat and left. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The First Visible Fruit of the Contemplative Life)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So, venerable sir, I ask the Blessed One as well:
  There are these common craftsmen: elephant-trainers, horse-trainers, charioteers, archers,
  standard bearers, camp marshals, supply corps officers, high royal officers, commandos,
  military heroes, armor-clad warriors, leather-clad warriors, domestic slaves,
  confectioners, barbers, bath attendants, cooks, garland-makers, laundrymen, weavers,
  basket-makers, potters, calculators, accountants, and any other craftsmen of a similar
  sort. They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here and now. They give
  happiness and pleasure to themselves, to their parents, wives, and children, to their
  friends and colleagues. They put in place an excellent presentation of offerings to
  priests and contemplatives, leading to heaven, resulting in happiness, conducive to a
  heavenly rebirth. Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible in the here and now?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, it is, great king. But first, with regard to
  that, I will ask you a counter-question. Answer however you please. Suppose there were a
  man of yours: your slave, your workman, rising in the morning before you, going to bed in
  the evening only after you, doing whatever you order, always acting to please you,
  speaking politely to you, always watching for the look on your face. The thought would
  occur to him: 'Isn't it amazing? Isn't it astounding? -- the destination, the results, of
  meritorious deeds. For this King Ajatasattu is a human being, and I, too, am a human
  being, yet King Ajatasattu enjoys himself supplied and replete with the five strands of
  sensual pleasure -- like a deity, as it were -- while I am his slave, his workman...always
  watching for the look on his face. I, too, should do meritorious deeds. What if I were to
  shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life
  into homelessness?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So after some time he shaves off his hair and beard,
  puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. Having
  thus gone forth he lives restrained in body, speech, and mind, content with the simplest
  food and shelter, delighting in solitude. Then suppose one of your men were to inform you:
  'You should know, your majesty, that that man of yours -- your slave, your
  workman...always watching for the look on your face...has gone forth from the household
  life into homelessness...content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in
  solitude.' Would you, thus informed, say, 'Bring that man back to me. Make him again be my
  slave, my workman...always watching for the look on my face!'?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Not at all, venerable sir. Rather, I am the one who
  should bow down to him, rise up out of respect for him, invite him to a seat, invite him
  to accept gifts of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick. And I
  would provide him with righteous safety, defense, and protection.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So what do you think, great king. With that being
  the case, is there a visible fruit of the contemplative life, or is there not?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, venerable sir. With that being the case, there
  certainly is a visible fruit of the contemplative life.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, great king, is the first fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible in the here and now, that I point out to you.&quot; </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Second Visible Fruit of the Contemplative Life)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But is it possible, venerable sir, to point out yet
  another fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, it is, great king. But first, with regard to
  that, I will ask you a counter-question. Answer however you please. Suppose there were a
  man of yours: a farmer, a householder, a taxpayer swelling the royal treasury. The thought
  would occur to him: 'Isn't it amazing? Isn't it astounding? -- the destination, the
  results, of meritorious deeds! For this King Ajatasattu is a human being, and I, too, am a
  human being, yet King Ajatasattu enjoys himself supplied and replete with the five strands
  of sensual pleasure -- like a deity, as it were -- while I am a farmer, a householder, a
  taxpayer swelling the royal treasury. I, too, should do meritorious deeds. What if I were
  to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household
  life into homelessness?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth,
  large or small; leaves his circle of relatives, large or small; shaves off his hair and
  beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness.
  Having thus gone forth he lives restrained in body, speech, and mind, content with the
  simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude. Then suppose one of your men were to
  inform you: 'You should know, your majesty, that that man of yours -- the farmer, the
  householder, the taxpayer swelling the royal treasury...has gone forth from the household
  life into homelessness...content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So what do you think, great king. With that being
  the case, is there a visible fruit of the contemplative life, or is there not?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, venerable sir. With that being the case, there
  certainly is a visible fruit of the contemplative life.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, great king, is the second fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible in the here and now, that I point out to you.&quot; </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Higher Fruits of the Contemplative Life)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But is it possible, venerable sir, to point out yet
  another fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, it is, great king. Listen and pay close
  attention. I will speak. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There is the case, great king, where a Tathagata
  appears in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened. He teaches the Dhamma admirable in
  its beginning, admirable in its middle, admirable in its end. He proclaims the holy life
  both in its particulars and in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A householder or householder's son, hearing the
  Dhamma, gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects: 'Household life is confining, a
  dusty path. The life gone forth is like the open air. It is not easy living at home to
  practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, like a polished shell. What if I
  were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the
  household life into homelessness?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth,
  large or small; leaves his circle of relatives, large or small; shaves off his hair and
  beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When he has thus gone forth, he lives restrained by
  the rules of the monastic code, seeing danger in the slightest faults. Consummate in his
  virtue, he guards the doors of his senses, is possessed of mindfulness and alertness, and
  is content. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Lesser Section on Virtue)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And how is a monk consummate in virtue? Abandoning
  the taking of life, he abstains from the taking of life. He dwells with his rod laid down,
  his knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living
  beings. This is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he
  abstains from taking what is not given. He takes only what is given, accepts only what is
  given, lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure. This, too, is
  part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Abandoning uncelibacy, he lives a celibate life,
  aloof, refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way. This, too, is part of
  his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false
  speech. He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the
  world. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>

  speech. What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from
  these people here. What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people
  apart from those people there. Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing
  those who are united, he loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things
  that create concord. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive
  speech. He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that go to
  the heart, that are polite, appealing and pleasing to people at large. This, too, is part
  of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle
  chatter. He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal,
  the Dhamma, and the Vinaya. He speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable,
  circumscribed, connected with the goal. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from damaging seed and plant life. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He eats only once a day, refraining from the evening
  meal and from food at the wrong time of day. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from dancing, singing, instrumental
  music, and from watching shows. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from wearing garlands and from
  beautifying himself with scents and cosmetics. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from high and luxurious beds and seats. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from accepting gold and money. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from accepting uncooked grain...raw
  meat...women and girls...male and female slaves...goats and sheep...fowl and
  pigs...elephants, cattle, steeds, and mares...fields and property. </font></p>

  deception, and fraud. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from mutilating, executing, imprisoning,

  has defeated his enemies sees no danger anywhere from his enemies, in the same way the
  monk thus consummate in virtue sees no danger anywhere from his restraint through virtue.
  Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue, he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of

  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Sense Restraint)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And how does a monk guard the doors of his senses?
  On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which -- if he
  were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye -- evil, unskillful qualities
  such as greed or distress might assail him. On hearing a sound with the ear...On smelling
  an odor with the nose...One tasting a flavor with the tongue...On touching a tactile
  sensation with the body...On cognizing an idea with the intellect, he does not grasp at
  any theme or details by which -- if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of
  the intellect -- evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him.

  his upper robe, and his bowl...when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting...when
  urinating and defecating...when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up,
  talking, and remaining silent, he acts with alertness. This is how a monk is possessed of
  mindfulness and alertness. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Contentedness)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And how is a monk content? Just as a bird, wherever
  it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden; so too is he content with a set of robes
  to provide for his body and almsfood to provide for his hunger. Wherever he goes, he takes
  only his barest necessities along. This is how a monk is content. </font></p>

  noble restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness and alertness, and this
  noble contentment, he seeks out a secluded dwelling: a forest, the shade of a tree, a
  mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle grove, the open air, a heap
  of straw. After his meal, returning from his alms round, he sits down, crosses his legs,
  holds his body erect, and brings mindfulness to the fore. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he
  dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of covetousness.
  Abandoning ill will and anger, he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will, sympathetic

  Abandoning sloth and torpor, he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and torpor,
  mindful, alert, percipient of light. He cleanses his mind of covetousness. Abandoning
  restlessness and anxiety, he dwells undisturbed, his mind inwardly stilled. He cleanses
  his mind of restlessness and anxiety. Abandoning uncertainty, he dwells having crossed
  over uncertainty, with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities. He cleanses
  his mind of uncertainty. </font></p>

  seriously ill. He does not enjoy his meals, and there is no strength in his body. As time

  that desolate country, safe and sound, with no loss of property. The thought would occur
  to him, 'Before, carrying money and goods, I was traveling by a road through desolate
  country. Now I have emerged from that desolate country, safe and sound, with no loss of my
  property.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In the same way, when these five hindrances are not
  abandoned in himself, the monk regards it as a debt, a sickness, a prison, slavery, a road
  through desolate country. But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself, he
  regards it as unindebtedness, good health, release from prison, freedom, a place of
  security. Seeing that they have been abandoned within him, he becomes glad. Glad, he
  becomes enraptured. Enraptured, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he is
  sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Four Jhanas)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures, withdrawn
  from unskillful mental qualities, he enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture and
  pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation. He
  permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure
  born from withdrawal. Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath
  powder into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again and again with water,
  so that his ball of bath powder -- saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within and without
  -- would nevertheless not drip; even so, the monk permeates...this very body with the
  rapture and pleasure born of withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by
  rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible
  here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thought
  and evaluation, he enters and remains in the second jhana: rapture and pleasure born of
  composure, one-pointedness of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation --
  internal assurance. He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the
  rapture and pleasure born of composure. Just like a lake with spring-water welling up from
  within, having no inflow from the east, west, north, or south, and with the skies
  supplying abundant showers time and again, so that the cool fount of water welling up from
  within the lake would permeate and pervade, suffuse and fill it with cool waters, there
  being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters; even so, the monk
  permeates...this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure. There is
  nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composure. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, is a fruit of the contemplative life,
  visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And furthermore, with the fading of rapture, he
  remains in equanimity, mindful and fully aware, and physically sensitive of pleasure. He
  enters and remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous and
  mindful, he has a pleasurable abiding.' He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this
  very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. Just as in a lotus pond, some of the
  lotuses, born and growing in the water, stay immersed in the water and flourish without
  standing up out of the water, so that they are permeated and pervaded, suffused and filled
  with cool water from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those lotuses would be
  unpervaded with cool water; even so, the monk permeates...this very body with the pleasure
  divested of rapture. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested
  of rapture. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, is a fruit of the contemplative life,
  visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure and
  stress -- as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress -- he enters and
  remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither-pleasure nor
  stress. He sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. Just as if a man were
  sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his
  body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body
  with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure,
  bright awareness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, great king, is a fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more
  sublime. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Insight Knowledge)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This
  body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother
  and father, nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing,
  dissolution, and dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up
  here.' Just as if there were a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water -- eight faceted,
  well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects, and going through the middle
  of it was a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread -- and a man with good eyesight,
  taking it in his hand, were to reflect on it thus: 'This is a beautiful beryl gem of the
  purest water, eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects.
  And this, going through the middle of it, is a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.'
  In the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished,
  free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk
  directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is
  endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother and father,
  nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution,
  and dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, great king, is a fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more
  sublime. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Mind-made Body)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body
  he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts,
  not inferior in its faculties. Just as if a man were to draw a reed from its sheath. The
  thought would occur to him: 'This is the sheath, this is the reed. The sheath is one
  thing, the reed another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' Or as if a man
  were to draw a sword from its scabbard. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the
  sword, this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword
  has been drawn out from the scabbard.' Or as if a man were to pull a snake out from its
  slough. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake
  is one thing, the slough another, but the snake has been pulled out from the slough.' In
  the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free
  from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk
  directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another
  body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its
  faculties. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, great king, is a fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more
  sublime. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Supranormal Powers)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers. He wields
  manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes
  one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as
  if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water
  without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like
  a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and
  powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. Just as a
  skilled potter or his assistant could craft from well-prepared clay whatever kind of
  pottery vessel he likes, or as a skilled ivory-carver or his assistant could craft from
  well-prepared ivory any kind of ivory-work he likes, or as a skilled goldsmith or his
  assistant could craft from well-prepared gold any kind of gold article he likes; in the
  same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from
  defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs
  and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers...He exercises influence with his body
  even as far as the Brahma worlds. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, great king, is a fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more
  sublime. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Clairaudience)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears -- by
  means of the divine ear-element, purified and surpassing the human -- both kinds of
  sounds: divine and human, whether near or far. Just as if a man traveling along a highway
  were to hear the sounds of kettledrums, small drums, conchs, cymbals, and tom-toms. He
  would know, 'That is the sound of kettledrums, that is the sound of small drums, that is
  the sound of conchs, that is the sound of cymbals, and that is the sound of tom-toms.' In
  the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free
  from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk
  directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears -- by means of the divine
  ear-element, purified and surpassing the human -- both kinds of sounds: divine and human,
  whether near or far. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, great king, is a fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more
  sublime. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Mind Reading)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other
  beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it
  with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind
  without passion as a mind without passion. He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with
  aversion, and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion. He discerns a mind with
  delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion.
  He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind, and a scattered mind as a scattered
  mind. He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind, and an unenlarged mind as an
  unenlarged mind. He discerns an excelled mind [one that is not at the most excellent
  level] as an excelled mind, and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind. He discerns a
  concentrated mind as a concentrated mind, and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated
  mind. He discerns a released mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an
  unreleased mind. Just as if a young woman -- or man -- fond of ornaments, examining the
  reflection of her own face in a bright mirror or a bowl of clear water would know
  'blemished' if it were blemished, or 'unblemished' if it were not. In the same way -- with
  his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant,
  malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs and inclines it to
  knowledge of the awareness of other beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other
  individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion
  as a mind with passion, and a mind without passion as a mind without passion...a released
  mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind. </font></p>

  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Recollection of Past Lives)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past
  lives (lit: previous homes). He recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two
  births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one
  thousand, one hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic
  expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion, [recollecting], 'There I had
  such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my
  experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I
  re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an
  appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my
  life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past
  lives in their modes and details. Just as if a man were to go from his home village to
  another village, and then from that village to yet another village, and then from that
  village back to his home village. The thought would occur to him, 'I went from my home
  village to that village over there. There I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked
  in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I went to that village
  over there, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and
  remained silent in such a way. From that village I came back home.' In the same way --
  with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects,
  pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs and
  inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives. He recollects his manifold
  past lives...in their modes and details. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, great king, is a fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more
  sublime. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Passing Away and Re-appearance of Beings)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and
  re-appearance of beings. He sees -- by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing
  the human -- beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior
  and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their
  kamma: 'These beings -- who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who
  reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of
  wrong views -- with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane
  of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings -- who
  were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble
  ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views --
  with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in
  the heavenly world.' Thus -- by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human
  -- he sees beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and
  superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.
  Just as if there were a tall building in the central square [of a town], and a man with
  good eyesight standing on top of it were to see people entering a house, leaving it,
  walking along the street, and sitting in the central square. The thought would occur to
  him, 'These people are entering a house, leaving it, walking along the streets, and
  sitting in the central square.' In the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated,
  purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and
  attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the
  passing away and re-appearance of beings. He sees -- by means of the divine eye, purified
  and surpassing the human -- beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they
  are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance
  with their kamma... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, great king, is a fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more
  sublime. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Ending of Mental Fermentations)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the
  mental fermentations. He discerns, as it is actually present, that 'This is stress...This
  is the origination of stress...This is the cessation of stress...This is the way leading
  to the cessation of stress...These are mental fermentations...This is the origination of
  fermentations...This is the cessation of fermentations...This is the way leading to the
  cessation of fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the
  fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance.
  With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the
  holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.' Just as if
  there were a pool of water in a mountain glen -- clear, limpid, and unsullied -- where a
  man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and
  also shoals of fish swimming about and resting, and it would occur to him, 'This pool of
  water is clear, limpid, and unsullied. Here are these shells, gravel, and pebbles, and
  also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting.' In the same way -- with his mind
  thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant,
  malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs and inclines it to
  the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. He discerns, as it is actually
  present, that 'This is stress...This is the origination of stress...This is the cessation
  of stress...This is the way leading to the cessation of stress...These are mental
  fermentations...This is the origination of fermentations...This is the cessation of
  fermentations...This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' His heart,
  thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentation of sensuality, the
  fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there is the
  knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task
  done. There is nothing further for this world.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, great king, is a fruit of the
  contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more
  sublime. And as for another visible fruit of the contemplative life, higher and more
  sublime than this, there is none.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this was said, King Ajatasattu said to the Blessed
  One: &quot;Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright
  what had been overturned, were to reveal what was hidden, were to show the way to one who
  was lost, or were to hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms,
  in the same way the Blessed One has -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma
  clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the community of monks.
  May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from
  this day forward, for life. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A transgression has overcome me, venerable sir, in
  that I was so foolish, so muddle-headed, and so unskilled as to kill my father -- a
  righteous man, a righteous king -- for the sake of sovereign rulership. May the Blessed
  One please accept this confession of my transgression as such, so that I may restrain
  myself in the future.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, great king, a transgression overcame you in
  that you were so foolish, so muddle-headed, and so unskilled as to kill your father -- a
  righteous man, a righteous king -- for the sake of sovereign rulership. But because you
  see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma, we accept
  your confession. For it is a cause of growth in the Dhamma and discipline of the noble
  ones when, seeing a transgression as such, one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma
  and exercises restraint in the future.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this was said, King Ajatasattu said to the Blessed
  One: &quot;Well, then, venerable sir, I am now taking leave. Many are my duties, many my
  responsibilities.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then do, great king, what you think it is now time
  to do.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So King Ajatasattu, delighting and rejoicing in the
  Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, bowed down to him, and -- after circumambulating
  him -- left. Not long after King Ajatasattu had left, the Blessed One addressed the monks:
  &quot;The king is wounded, monks. The king is incapacitated. Had he not killed his father
  -- that righteous man, that righteous king -- the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye would
  have arisen to him as he sat in this very seat.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks
  delighted in the Blessed One's words. </font></p>
