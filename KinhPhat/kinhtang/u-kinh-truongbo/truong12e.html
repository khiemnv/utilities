  To Lohicca</font></h2>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000"><strong>translated by
  Bhikkhu Thanissaro</strong></font></p>
  <hr width="25%" align="center">
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">I </font><font face="Times New Roman">have heard
  that on one occasion the Blessed One was on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a
  large community of monks -- approximately 500 monks in all -- and arrived at Salavatika.
  Now at that time the brahmin Lohicca was reigning with feudatory rights over Salavatika --
  together with its wealth, grass, timber, and grain -- through a royal grant bestowed by
  King Pasenadi Kosala. And at that time an evil viewpoint to this effect had arisen to him:
  &quot;Suppose that a priest or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine. Having
  arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not declare it to anyone else, for what can one
  person do for another? It would be just the same as if, having cut through an old bond,
  one were to make another new bond. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for
  what can one person do for another?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Lohicca heard it said, &quot;Gotama the contemplative
  -- the son of the Sakyans, having gone forth from the Sakyan clan -- on a wandering tour
  among the Kosalans with a large community of monks -- approximately 500 monks in all --
  has arrived at Salavatika. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: 'He
  is indeed a Blessed One, worthy, and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge and
  conduct, well-gone, a knower of the cosmos, an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready
  to be tamed, teacher of human and divine beings, awakened, blessed. He has made known --
  having realized it through direct knowledge -- this world with its devas, maras, and
  brahmas, its generations with their contemplatives and priests, their rulers and common
  people; has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle,
  admirable in the end; has expounded the holy life both in its particulars and in its
  essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. It is good to see such a worthy one.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So Lohicca said to Rosika the barber: &quot;Come, dear
  Rosika. Go to Gotama the contemplative and, on arrival, ask whether he is free from
  illness and affliction, is carefree, strong, and living in comfort, saying: 'The brahmin
  Lohicca, Master Gotama, asks whether you are free from illness and affliction, are
  carefree, strong, and living in comfort.' And then say: 'May Master Gotama, together with
  the community of monks, consent to tomorrow's meal with the brahmin Lohicca.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Responding, &quot;As you say, sir,&quot; to the brahmin
  Lohicca, Rosika the barber went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowing down to him,
  sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, &quot;The brahmin
  Lohicca, lord, asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness and affliction, is
  carefree, strong, and living in comfort. And he says, 'May the Blessed One, together with
  the community of monks, consent to tomorrow's meal with the brahmin Lohicca.'&quot; The
  Blessed One consented through silence. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Rosika the barber, understanding the Blessed One's
  consent, rose from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circumambulated him -- keeping
  him to his right -- and returned to the brahmin Lohicca. On arrival he said to him,
  &quot;I have informed the Blessed One of your words, [saying,] 'The brahmin Lohicca, lord,
  asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness and affliction, is carefree, strong, and
  living in comfort. And he says, &quot;May the Blessed One, together with the community of
  monks, consent to tomorrow's meal with the brahmin Lohicca.&quot;' And the Blessed One has
  consented.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, as the night was ending, the brahmin Lohicca had
  choice staple and non-staple foods prepared in his own home and then said to Rosika the
  barber, &quot;Come, dear Rosika. Go to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival announce
  the time, [saying,] 'It is time, Master Gotama. The meal is ready.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Responding, &quot;As you say, sir,&quot; to the brahmin
  Lohicca, Rosika the barber went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowing down to him,
  stood to one side. As he was standing there, he announced the time, [saying,] &quot;It is
  time, lord. The meal is ready.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Blessed One, having put on his robes early in the
  morning, carrying his bowl and outer robe, went together with a community of monks to
  Salavatika. Meanwhile, Rosika the barber was following right behind the Blessed One and
  said to him, &quot;Lord, an evil viewpoint to this effect has arisen to the brahmin
  Lohicca: 'Suppose that a priest or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine.
  Having arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not declare it to anyone else, for what
  can one person do for another? It would be just the same as if, having cut through an old
  bond, one were to make another new bond. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed,
  for what can one person do for another?' It would be good if the Blessed One would extract
  the brahmin Lohicca from this evil viewpoint.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Perhaps that will be, Rosika. Perhaps that will
  be.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Blessed One went to the brahmin Lohicca's home.
  On arrival, he sat down on a seat made ready. The brahmin Lohicca, with his own hand,
  served and satisfied the Blessed One and the community of monks with choice staple and
  non-staple foods. Then, when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his
  bowl, the brahmin Lohicca took a lower seat and sat down to one side. As he was sitting
  there, the Blessed One said to him, &quot;Is it true, Lohicca, that an evil viewpoint to
  this effect has arisen to you: 'Suppose that a priest or contemplative were to arrive at a
  skillful doctrine. Having arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not declare it to
  anyone else, for what can one person do for another? It would be just the same as if,
  having cut through an old bond, one were to make another new bond. I say that such a thing
  is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?'?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, Master Gotama.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What do you think, Lohicca. Don't you reign over
  Salavatika?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, Master Gotama.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now, suppose someone were to say, 'The brahmin
  Lohicca reigns over Salavatika. He alone should consume the fruits and revenues of
  Salavatika, and not share them with others.' Would someone speaking in this way be a
  creator of obstacles for your subjects, or would he not?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He would be a creator of obstacles, Master
  Gotama.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And, being a creator of obstacles, would he be
  sympathetic for their welfare or not?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He would not be sympathetic for their welfare,
  Master Gotama.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And in one not sympathetic for their welfare, would
  his mind be established in good will for them, or in animosity?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In animosity, Master Gotama.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When the mind is established in animosity, is there
  wrong view or right view?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Wrong view, Master Gotama.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now, for one of wrong view, Lohicca, I tell you,
  there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What do you think, Lohicca. Doesn't King Pasenadi
  Kosala reign over Kasi and Kosala?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, Master Gotama.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now, suppose someone were to say, 'King Pasenadi
  Kosala reigns over Kasi and Kosala. He alone should consume the fruits and revenues of
  Kasi and Kosala, and not share them with others.' Would someone speaking in this way be a
  creator of obstacles for King Pasenadi's subjects -- you and others -- or would he
  not?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He would be a creator of obstacles, Master
  Gotama.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And, being a creator of obstacles, would he be
  sympathetic for their welfare or not?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He would not be sympathetic for their welfare,
  Master Gotama.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And in one not sympathetic for their welfare, would
  his mind be established in good will for them, or in animosity?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In animosity, Master Gotama.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When the mind is established in animosity, is there
  wrong view or right view?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Wrong view, Master Gotama.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now, for one of wrong view, Lohicca, I tell you,
  there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So then, Lohicca, if anyone were to say, 'The
  brahmin Lohicca reigns over Salavatika. He alone should consume the fruits and revenues of
  Salavatika, and not share them with others,' he, speaking in this way, would be a creator
  of obstacles for your subjects. Being a creator of obstacles, he would not be sympathetic
  for their welfare. In one not sympathetic for their welfare, the mind would be established
  in animosity for them. When the mind is established in animosity, there is wrong view. For
  one of wrong view, I tell you, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal
  womb. In the same way, if anyone were to say, 'Suppose that a priest or contemplative were
  to arrive at a skillful doctrine. Having arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not
  declare it to anyone else, for what can one person do for another? It would be just the
  same as if, having cut through an old bond, one were to make another new bond. I say that
  such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?' -- he,
  speaking in this way, would be a creator of obstacles for those children of good family
  who, coming to the doctrine and discipline revealed by the Tathagata, attain the sort of
  grand distinction where they attain the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of
  once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, the fruit of arahantship; and for those who
  ripen deva wombs for the sake of bringing about the deva state. Being a creator of
  obstacles, he would not be sympathetic for their welfare. In one not sympathetic for their
  welfare, the mind would be established in animosity for them. When the mind is established
  in animosity, there is wrong view. For one of wrong view, I tell you, there is one of two
  destinations: either hell or the animal womb. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And if anyone were to say, 'King Pasenadi Kosala
  reigns over Kasi and Kosala. He alone should consume the fruits and revenues of Kasi and
  Kosala, and not share them with others,' he, speaking in this way, would be a creator of
  obstacles for King Pasenadi's subjects -- you and others. Being a creator of obstacles, he
  would not be sympathetic for their welfare. In one not sympathetic for their welfare, the
  mind would be established in animosity for them. When the mind is established in
  animosity, there is wrong view. For one of wrong view, I tell you, there is one of two
  destinations: either hell or the animal womb. In the same way, if anyone were to say,
  'Suppose that a priest or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine. Having
  arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not declare it to anyone else, for what can one
  person do for another? It would be just the same as if, having cut through an old bond,
  one were to make another new bond. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for
  what can one person do for another?' -- he, speaking in this way, would be a creator of
  obstacles for those children of good family who, coming to the doctrine and discipline
  revealed by the Tathagata, attain the sort of grand distinction where they attain the
  fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, the fruit
  of arahantship; and also for those who ripen deva wombs for the sake of bringing about the
  deva state. Being a creator of obstacles, he would not be sympathetic for their welfare.
  In one not sympathetic for their welfare, the mind would be established in animosity for
  them. When the mind is established in animosity, there is wrong view. For one of wrong
  view, I tell you, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Lohicca, there are these three sorts of teacher who
  are worthy of criticism in the world, and when anyone criticizes these sorts of teachers,
  the criticism is true, factual, righteous, and unblameworthy. Which three? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There is the case where a certain teacher has not
  attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life
  into homelessness. He, not having attained that goal of the contemplative life, teaches
  his disciples, 'This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.' His disciples don't
  listen, don't lend ear, don't put forth an intent for gnosis. They practice in a way
  deviating from the teacher's instructions. He should be criticized, saying, 'You,
  venerable sir, have not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes
  forth from the home life into homelessness. Not having attained that goal of the
  contemplative life, you teach your disciples, &quot;This is for your welfare. This is for
  your happiness.&quot; Your disciples don't listen, don't lend ear, don't put forth an
  intent for gnosis, and practice in a way deviating from the teacher's instructions. It's
  just as if a man were to pursue [a woman] who pulls away, or to embrace one who turns her
  back. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for
  another?' This is the first teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world, and when
  anyone criticizes this sort of teacher, the criticism is true, factual, righteous, and
  unblameworthy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then there is the case where a certain teacher has
  not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home
  life into homelessness. He, not having attained that goal of the contemplative life,
  teaches his disciples, 'This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.' His
  disciples listen, lend ear, put forth an intent for gnosis, and practice in a way not
  deviating from the teacher's instructions. He should be criticized, saying, 'You,
  venerable sir, have not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes
  forth from the home life into homelessness. Not having attained that goal of the
  contemplative life, you teach your disciples, &quot;This is for your welfare. This is for
  your happiness.&quot; Your disciples listen, lend ear, put forth an intent for gnosis, and
  practice in a way not deviating from the teacher's instructions. It's just as if a man,
  neglecting his own field, were to imagine that another's field should be weeded. I say
  that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?' This
  is the second teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world, and when anyone criticizes
  this sort of teacher, the criticism is true, factual, righteous, and unblameworthy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then there is the case where a certain teacher has
  attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life
  into homelessness. He, having attained that goal of the contemplative life, teaches his
  disciples, 'This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.' His disciples don't
  listen, don't lend ear, don't put forth an intent for gnosis. They practice in a way
  deviating from the teacher's instructions. He should be criticized, saying, 'You,
  venerable sir, have attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth
  from the home life into homelessness. Having attained that goal of the contemplative life,
  you teach your disciples, &quot;This is for your welfare. This is for your
  happiness.&quot; Your disciples don't listen, don't lend ear, don't put forth an intent
  for gnosis, and practice in a way deviating from the teacher's instructions. It's just as
  if, having cut through an old bond, one were to make another new bond. I say that such a
  thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?' This is the third
  teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world, and when anyone criticizes this sort of
  teacher, the criticism is true, factual, righteous, and unblameworthy.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this was said, the brahmin Lohicca said to the
  Blessed One, &quot;But is there, Master Gotama, any teacher who is not worthy of criticism
  in the world?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There is, Lohicca, a teacher who is not worthy of
  criticism in the world.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But which teacher, Master Gotama, is not worthy of
  criticism in the world?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There is the case, Lohicca, where a Tathagata
  appears in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened. He teaches the Dhamma admirable in
  its beginning, admirable in its middle, admirable in its end. He proclaims the holy life
  both in its particulars and in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A householder or householder's son, hearing the
  Dhamma, gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects: 'Household life is confining, a
  dusty path. The life gone forth is like the open air. It is not easy living at home to
  practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, like a polished shell. What if I
  were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the
  household life into homelessness?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth,
  large or small; leaves his circle of relatives, large or small; shaves off his hair and
  beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When he has thus gone forth, he lives restrained by
  the rules of the monastic code, seeing danger in the slightest faults. Consummate in his
  virtue, he guards the doors of his senses, is possessed of mindfulness and alertness, and
  is content <em>[for details, see <a href="http://www.viet.net/marketplace/">DN 2</a>]</em>... </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Abandoning the Hindrances)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue, this
  noble restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness and alertness, and this
  noble contentment, he seeks out a secluded dwelling: a wilderness, the shade of a tree, a
  mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a forest grove, the open air, a heap
  of straw. After his meal, returning from his alms round, he sits down, crosses his legs,
  holds his body erect, and brings mindfulness to the fore. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he
  dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of covetousness.
  Abandoning ill will and anger, he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will, sympathetic
  with the welfare of all living beings. He cleanses his mind of ill will and anger.
  Abandoning sloth and drowsiness, he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and
  drowsiness, mindful, alert, percipient of light. He cleanses his mind of sloth and
  drowsiness. Abandoning restlessness and anxiety, he dwells undisturbed, his mind inwardly
  stilled. He cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxiety. Abandoning uncertainty, he
  dwells having crossed over uncertainty, with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental
  qualities. He cleanses his mind of uncertainty. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Suppose that a man, taking a loan, invests it in his
  business affairs. His business affairs succeed. He repays his old debts and there is extra
  left over for maintaining his wife. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, taking a
  loan, I invested it in my business affairs. Now my business affairs have succeeded. I have
  repaid my old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife.' Because of that
  he would experience joy and happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now suppose that a man falls sick -- in pain and
  seriously ill. He does not enjoy his meals, and there is no strength in his body. As time
  passes, he eventually recovers from that sickness. He enjoys his meals and there is
  strength in his body. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was sick...Now I am
  recovered from that sickness. I enjoy my meals and there is strength in my body.' Because
  of that he would experience joy and happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now suppose that a man is bound in prison. As time
  passes, he eventually is released from that bondage, safe and sound, with no loss of
  property. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was bound in prison. Now I am
  released from that bondage, safe and sound, with no loss of my property.' Because of that
  he would experience joy and happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now suppose that a man is a slave, subject to
  others, not subject to himself, unable to go where he likes. As time passes, he eventually
  is released from that slavery, subject to himself, not subject to others, freed, able to
  go where he likes. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was a slave...Now I am
  released from that slavery, subject to myself, not subject to others, freed, able to go
  where I like.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now suppose that a man, carrying money and goods, is
  traveling by a road through desolate country. As time passes, he eventually emerges from
  that desolate country, safe and sound, with no loss of property. The thought would occur
  to him, 'Before, carrying money and goods, I was traveling by a road through desolate
  country. Now I have emerged from that desolate country, safe and sound, with no loss of my
  property.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In the same way, when these five hindrances are not
  abandoned in himself, the monk regards it as a debt, a sickness, a prison, slavery, a road
  through desolate country. But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself, he
  regards it as unindebtedness, good health, release from prison, freedom, a place of
  security. Seeing that they have been abandoned within him, he becomes glad. Glad, he
  becomes enraptured. Enraptured, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he is
  sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Four Jhanas)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures, withdrawn
  from unskillful mental qualities, he enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture and
  pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation. He
  permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure
  born from withdrawal. Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath
  powder into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again and again with water,
  so that his ball of bath powder -- saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within and without
  -- would nevertheless not drip; even so, the monk permeates...this very body with the
  rapture and pleasure born of withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by
  rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort
  of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and
  if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual,
  unrighteous, and blameworthy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thought
  and evaluation, he enters and remains in the second jhana: rapture and pleasure born of
  composure, one-pointedness of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation --
  internal assurance. He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the
  rapture and pleasure born of composure. Just like a lake with spring-water welling up from
  within, having no inflow from the east, west, north, or south, and with the skies
  supplying abundant showers time and again, so that the cool fount of water welling up from
  within the lake would permeate and pervade, suffuse and fill it with cool waters, there
  being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters; even so, the monk
  permeates...this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure. There is
  nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composure. When a
  disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher
  not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of
  teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, and blameworthy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And furthermore, with the fading of rapture, he
  remains in equanimity, mindful and alert, and physically sensitive of pleasure. He enters
  and remains in the third jhana, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful,
  he has a pleasurable abiding.' He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very
  body with the pleasure divested of rapture. Just as in a lotus pond, some of the lotuses,
  born and growing in the water, stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up
  out of the water, so that they are permeated and pervaded, suffused and filled with cool
  water from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded
  with cool water; even so, the monk permeates...this very body with the pleasure divested
  of rapture. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of
  rapture. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca,
  that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize
  this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, and
  blameworthy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure and
  pain -- as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress -- he enters and remains
  in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain. He
  sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. Just as if a man were sitting
  covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to
  which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body with a
  pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright
  awareness. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca,
  that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize

  blameworthy. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Insight Knowledge)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This
  body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother
  and father, nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing,
  dissolution, and dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up
  here.' Just as if there were a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water -- eight faceted,
  well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects, and going through the middle
  of it was a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread -- and a man with good eyesight,
  taking it in his hand, were to reflect on it thus: 'This is a beautiful beryl gem of the
  purest water, eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects.
  And this, going through the middle of it, is a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.'
  In the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished,
  free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk
  directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is
  endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother and father,
  nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution,

  a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher
  not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of
  teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, and blameworthy. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Mind-made Body)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body
  he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts,
  not inferior in its faculties. Just as if a man were to draw a reed from its sheath. The
  thought would occur to him: 'This is the sheath, this is the reed. The sheath is one
  thing, the reed another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' Or as if a man
  were to draw a sword from its scabbard. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the
  sword, this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword
  has been drawn out from the scabbard.' Or as if a man were to pull a snake out from its
  slough. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake
  is one thing, the slough another, but the snake has been pulled out from the slough.' In
  the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free
  from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk
  directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another
  body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its

  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Supranormal Powers)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers. He wields
  manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes
  one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as
  if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water
  without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like
  a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and
  powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. Just as a
  skilled potter or his assistant could craft from well-prepared clay whatever kind of
  pottery vessel he likes, or as a skilled ivory-carver or his assistant could craft from
  well-prepared ivory any kind of ivory-work he likes, or as a skilled goldsmith or his
  assistant could craft from well-prepared gold any kind of gold article he likes; in the
  same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from
  defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs
  and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers...He exercises influence with his body
  even as far as the Brahma worlds. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand
  distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if
  anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual,
  unrighteous, and blameworthy. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Clairaudience)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears -- by
  means of the divine ear-element, purified and surpassing the human -- both kinds of
  sounds: divine and human, whether near or far. Just as if a man traveling along a highway
  were to hear the sounds of kettledrums, small drums, conchs, cymbals, and tom-toms. He
  would know, 'That is the sound of kettledrums, that is the sound of small drums, that is
  the sound of conchs, that is the sound of cymbals, and that is the sound of tom-toms.' In
  the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free
  from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk
  directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears -- by means of the divine

  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Mind Reading)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other
  beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it
  with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind
  without passion as a mind without passion. He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with
  aversion, and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion. He discerns a mind with
  delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion.
  He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind, and a scattered mind as a scattered
  mind. He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind, and an unenlarged mind as an
  unenlarged mind. He discerns an excelled mind [one that is not at the most excellent
  level] as an excelled mind, and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind. He discerns a
  concentrated mind as a concentrated mind, and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated
  mind. He discerns a released mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an
  unreleased mind. Just as if a young woman -- or man -- fond of ornaments, examining the
  reflection of her own face in a bright mirror or a bowl of clear water would know
  'blemished' if it were blemished, or 'unblemished' if it were not. In the same way -- with
  his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant,
  malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs and inclines it to
  knowledge of the awareness of other beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other
  individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion
  as a mind with passion, and a mind without passion as a mind without passion...a released
  mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind. When a disciple of

  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Recollection of Past Lives)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past
  lives (lit: previous homes). He recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two
  births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one
  thousand, one hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic
  expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion, [recollecting], 'There I had
  such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my
  experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I
  re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an
  appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my
  life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past
  lives in their modes and details. Just as if a man were to go from his home village to
  another village, and then from that village to yet another village, and then from that
  village back to his home village. The thought would occur to him, 'I went from my home
  village to that village over there. There I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked
  in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I went to that village
  over there, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and
  remained silent in such a way. From that village I came back home.' In the same way --
  with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects,
  pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs and
  inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives. He recollects his manifold
  past lives...in their modes and details. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of
  grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if

  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Passing Away and Re-appearance of Beings)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and
  re-appearance of beings. He sees -- by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing
  the human -- beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior
  and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their
  kamma: 'These beings -- who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who
  reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of
  wrong views -- with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane
  of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings -- who
  were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble
  ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views --
  with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in
  the heavenly world.' Thus -- by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human
  -- he sees beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and
  superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.
  Just as if there were a tall building in the central square [of a town], and a man with
  good eyesight standing on top of it were to see people entering a house, leaving it,
  walking along the street, and sitting in the central square. The thought would occur to
  him, 'These people are entering a house, leaving it, walking along the streets, and
  sitting in the central square.' In the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated,
  purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and
  attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the
  passing away and re-appearance of beings. He sees -- by means of the divine eye, purified

  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Ending of Mental Fermentations)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the
  mental fermentations. He discerns, as it is actually present, that 'This is stress...This
  is the origination of stress...This is the cessation of stress...This is the way leading
  to the cessation of stress...These are mental fermentations...This is the origination of
  fermentations...This is the cessation of fermentations...This is the way leading to the
  cessation of fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the
  fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance.
  With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the
  holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.' Just as if
  there were a pool of water in a mountain glen -- clear, limpid, and unsullied -- where a
  man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and
  also shoals of fish swimming about and resting, and it would occur to him, 'This pool of
  water is clear, limpid, and unsullied. Here are these shells, gravel, and pebbles, and
  also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting.' In the same way -- with his mind
  thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant,
  malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs and inclines it to
  the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. He discerns, as it is actually

  fermentations...This is the origination of fermentations...This is the cessation of
  fermentations...This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' His heart,
  thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentation of sensuality, the

  unfactual, unrighteous, and blameworthy.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this was said, the brahmin Lohicca said to the
  Blessed One: &quot;Master Gotama, it's as if a man, having seized by the hair another man
  who was falling into the pit of hell, were to pull him up and set him on firm ground. In
  the same way, Master Gotama has pulled me up as I was falling into the pit of hell and has
  set me on firm ground. Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to
  place upright what had been overturned, were to reveal what was hidden, were to show the
  way to one who was lost, or were to hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes
  could see forms, in the same way Master Gotama has -- through many lines of reasoning --
  made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the
  community of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him
  for refuge, from this day forward, for life.&quot; </font></p>
