  <hr width="25%" align="center">
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font> have heard that on one occasion
  the Blessed One was staying in the Kuru country. Now there is a town of the Kurus called
  Kammasadhamma. There the Blessed One addressed the monks, &quot;Monks.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Venerable sir,&quot; the monks replied. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Blessed One said this: &quot;This is the direct path
  for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the
  disappearance of pain and distress, for the attainment of the right method, and for the
  realization of Unbinding -- in other words, the four frames of reference. Which four? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There is the case where a monk remains focused on
  the body in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and
  distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings... mind... mental
  qualities in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and
  distress with reference to the world. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(A. Body)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And how does a monk remain focused on the body in
  and of itself? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>[1]</b> &quot;There is the case where a monk -- having
  gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building -- sits down
  folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
  [lit: the front of the chest]. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Breathing in long, he discerns that he is breathing
  in long; or breathing out long, he discerns that he is breathing out long. Or breathing in
  short, he discerns that he is breathing in short; or breathing out short, he discerns that
  he is breathing out short. He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the entire body
  and to breathe out sensitive to the entire body. He trains himself to breathe in calming
  bodily fabrication and to breathe out calming bodily fabrication. Just as a skilled turner
  or his apprentice, when making a long turn, discerns that he is making a long turn, or
  when making a short turn discerns that he is making a short turn; in the same way the
  monk, when breathing in long, discerns that he is breathing in long; or breathing out
  short, he discerns that he is breathing out short... He trains himself to breathe in
  calming bodily fabrication, and to breathe out calming bodily fabrication. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the
  body in and of itself, or externally on the body in and of itself, or both internally and
  externally on the body in and of itself. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of
  origination with regard to the body, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the
  body, or on the phenomenon of origination and passing away with regard to the body. Or his
  mindfulness that 'There is a body' is maintained to the extent of knowledge and
  remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the
  world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>[2]</b> &quot;Furthermore, when walking, the monk
  discerns that he is walking. When standing, he discerns that he is standing. When sitting,
  he discerns that he is sitting. When lying down, he discerns that he is lying down. Or
  however his body is disposed, that is how he discerns it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the
  body in and of itself, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in the world. This
  is how a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>[3]</b> &quot;Furthermore, when going forward and
  returning, he makes himself fully alert; when looking toward and looking away... when
  bending and extending his limbs... when carrying his outer cloak, his upper robe and his
  bowl... when eating, drinking, chewing, and savoring... when urinating and defecating...
  when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and remaining silent,
  he makes himself fully alert. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the
  body in and of itself, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in the world. This
  is how a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>[4]</b> &quot;Furthermore... just as if a sack with
  openings at both ends were full of various kinds of grain -- wheat, rice, mung beans,
  kidney beans, sesame seeds, husked rice -- and a man with good eyesight, pouring it out,
  were to reflect, 'This is wheat. This is rice. These are mung beans. These are kidney
  beans. These are sesame seeds. This is husked rice,' in the same way, monks, a monk
  reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up, from the crown of the head on
  down, surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things: 'In this body there
  are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendons, bones, bone marrow,
  kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, large intestines, small intestines, gorge,
  feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, skin-oil, saliva, mucus, fluid in the
  joints, urine.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the
  body in and of itself, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in the world. This
  is how a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>[5]</b> &quot;Furthermore... just as a skilled butcher
  or his apprentice, having killed a cow, would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into
  pieces, the monk contemplates this very body -- however it stands, however it is disposed
  -- in terms of properties: 'In this body there is the earth property, the liquid property,
  the fire property, and the wind property.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the
  body in and of itself, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in the world. This
  is how a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>[6]</b> &quot;Furthermore, as if he were to see a
  corpse cast away in a charnel ground -- one day, two days, three days dead -- bloated,
  livid, and festering, he applies it to this very body, 'This body, too: Such is its
  nature, such is its future, such its unavoidable fate'... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Or again, as if he were to see a corpse cast away in
  a charnel ground, picked at by crows, vultures, and hawks, by dogs, hyenas, and various
  other creatures... a skeleton smeared with flesh and blood, connected with tendons... a
  fleshless skeleton smeared with blood, connected with tendons... a skeleton without flesh
  or blood, connected with tendons... bones detached from their tendons, scattered in all
  directions -- here a hand bone, there a foot bone, here a shin bone, there a thigh bone,
  here a hip bone, there a back bone, here a rib, there a chest bone, here a shoulder bone,
  there a neck bone, here a jaw bone, there a tooth, here a skull... the bones whitened,
  somewhat like the color of shells... piled up, more than a year old... decomposed into a
  powder: He applies it to this very body, 'This body, too: Such is its nature, such is its
  future, such its unavoidable fate.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the
  body in and of itself, or externally on the body in and of itself, or both internally and
  externally on the body in and of itself. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of
  origination with regard to the body, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the
  body, or on the phenomenon of origination and passing away with regard to the body. Or his
  mindfulness that 'There is a body' is maintained to the extent of knowledge and
  remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the
  world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(B. Feelings)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And how does a monk remain focused on feelings in
  and of themselves? There is the case where a monk, when feeling a painful feeling,
  discerns that he is feeling a painful feeling. When feeling a pleasant feeling, he
  discerns that he is feeling a pleasant feeling. When feeling a
  neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he discerns that he is feeling a
  neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When feeling a painful feeling of the flesh, he
  discerns that he is feeling a painful feeling of the flesh. When feeling a painful feeling
  not of the flesh, he discerns that he is feeling a painful feeling not of the flesh. When
  feeling a pleasant feeling of the flesh, he discerns that he is feeling a pleasant feeling
  of the flesh. When feeling a pleasant feeling not of the flesh, he discerns that he is
  feeling a pleasant feeling not of the flesh. When feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant
  feeling of the flesh, he discerns that he is feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant
  feeling of the flesh. When feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling not of the
  flesh, he discerns that he is feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling not of the
  flesh. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on
  feelings in and of themselves, or externally on feelings in and of themselves, or both
  internally and externally on feelings in and of themselves. Or he remains focused on the
  phenomenon of origination with regard to feelings, on the phenomenon of passing away with
  regard to feelings, or on the phenomenon of origination and passing away with regard to
  feelings. Or his mindfulness that 'There are feelings' is maintained to the extent of
  knowledge and remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging to)
  anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on feelings in and of
  themselves. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(C. Mind)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And how does a monk remain focused on the mind in
  and of itself? There is the case where a monk, when the mind has passion, discerns that
  the mind has passion. When the mind is without passion, he discerns that the mind is
  without passion. When the mind has aversion, he discerns that the mind has aversion. When
  the mind is without aversion, he discerns that the mind is without aversion. When the mind
  has delusion, he discerns that the mind has delusion. When the mind is without delusion,
  he discerns that the mind is without delusion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When the mind is restricted, he discerns that the
  mind is restricted. When the mind is scattered, he discerns that the mind is scattered.
  When the mind is enlarged, he discerns that the mind is enlarged. When the mind is not
  enlarged, he discerns that the mind is not enlarged. When the mind is surpassed, he
  discerns that the mind is surpassed. When the mind is unsurpassed, he discerns that the
  mind is unsurpassed. When the mind is concentrated, he discerns that the mind is
  concentrated. When the mind is not concentrated, he discerns that the mind is not
  concentrated. When the mind is released, he discerns that the mind is released. When the
  mind is not released, he discerns that the mind is not released. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the
  mind in and of itself, or externally on the mind in and of itself, or both internally and
  externally on the mind in and of itself. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of
  origination with regard to the mind, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the
  mind, or on the phenomenon of origination and passing away with regard to the mind. Or his
  mindfulness that 'There is a mind' is maintained to the extent of knowledge and
  remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the
  world. This is how a monk remains focused on the mind in and of itself. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(D. Mental Qualities)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And how does a monk remain focused on mental
  qualities in and of themselves? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>[1]</b> &quot;There is the case where a monk remains
  focused on mental qualities in and of themselves with reference to the <i>five hindrances.</i>
  And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in and of themselves with reference
  to the five hindrances? There is the case where, there being sensual desire present
  within, a monk discerns that 'There is sensual desire present within me.' Or, there being
  no sensual desire present within, he discerns that 'There is no sensual desire present
  within me.' He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen sensual desire. And he
  discerns how there is the abandoning of sensual desire once it has arisen. And he discerns
  how there is no further appearance in the future of sensual desire that has been
  abandoned. (The same formula is repeated for the remaining hindrances: ill will, sloth and
  drowsiness, restlessness and anxiety, and uncertainty.) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on mental
  qualities in and of themselves, or externally on mental qualities in and of themselves, or
  both internally and externally on mental qualities in and of themselves. Or he remains
  focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to mental qualities, on the
  phenomenon of passing away with regard to mental qualities, or on the phenomenon of
  origination and passing away with regard to mental qualities. Or his mindfulness that
  'There are mental qualities' is maintained to the extent of knowledge and remembrance. And
  he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is
  how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves with reference to the
  five hindrances. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>[2]</b> &quot;Furthermore, the monk remains focused on
  mental qualities in and of themselves with reference to the <i>five aggregates for
  clinging/sustenance.</i> And how does he remain focused on mental qualities in and of
  themselves with reference to the five aggregates for clinging/sustenance? There is the
  case where a monk [discerns]: 'Such is form, such its origination, such its disappearance.
  Such is feeling... Such is perception... Such are fabrications... Such is consciousness,
  such its origination, such its disappearance.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the
  mental qualities in and of themselves, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in
  the world. This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves
  with reference to the five aggregates for clinging/sustenance. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>[3]</b> &quot;Furthermore, the monk remains focused on
  mental qualities in and of themselves with reference to the <i>sixfold internal and
  external sense media.</i> And how does he remain focused on mental qualities in and of
  themselves with reference to the sixfold internal and external sense media? There is the
  case where he discerns the eye, he discerns forms, he discerns the fetter that arises
  dependent on both. He discerns how there is the arising of an unarisen fetter. And he
  discerns how there is the abandoning of a fetter once it has arisen. And he discerns how
  there is no further appearance in the future of a fetter that has been abandoned. (The
  same formula is repeated for the remaining sense media: ear, nose, tongue, body, and
  intellect.) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the
  mental qualities in and of themselves, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in
  the world. This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves
  with reference to the sixfold internal and external sense media. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>[4]</b> &quot;Furthermore, the monk remains focused on
  mental qualities in and of themselves with reference to the <i>seven factors of awakening.</i>
  And how does he remain focused on mental qualities in and of themselves with reference to
  the seven factors of awakening? There is the case where, there being mindfulness as a
  factor of awakening present within, he discerns that 'Mindfulness as a factor of awakening
  is present within me.' Or, there being no mindfulness as a factor of awakening present
  within, he discerns that 'Mindfulness as a factor of awakening is not present within me.'
  He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen mindfulness as a factor of awakening. And
  he discerns how there is the culmination of the development of mindfulness as a factor of
  awakening once it has arisen. (The same formula is repeated for the remaining factors of
  awakening: analysis of qualities, persistence, rapture, serenity, concentration, and
  equanimity.) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on mental
  qualities in and of themselves, or externally... unsustained by (not clinging to) anything
  in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves
  with reference to the seven factors of awakening. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>[5]</b> &quot;Furthermore, the monk remains focused on
  mental qualities in and of themselves with reference to the <i>four noble truths.</i> And
  how does he remain focused on mental qualities in and of themselves with reference to the
  four noble truths? There is the case where he discerns, as it is actually present, that
  'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress...
  This is the way leading to the cessation of stress.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>[a]</b> &quot;Now what is the noble truth of stress?
  Birth is stress, aging is stress, death is stressful; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress,
  and despair are stress; association with the unbeloved is stress; separation from the
  loved is stress; not getting what is wanted is stress; not getting what is wanted is
  stress. In short, the five aggregates for clinging/sustenance are stress. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is <i>birth</i>? Whatever birth, taking
  birth, descent, coming-to-be, coming-forth, appearance of aggregates, and acquisition of
  [sense] spheres of the various beings in this or that group of beings, that is called
  birth. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is <i>aging</i>? Whatever aging,
  decrepitude, brokenness, graying, wrinkling, decline of life-force, weakening of the
  faculties of the various beings in this or that group of beings, that is called aging. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is <i>death</i>? Whatever deceasing,
  passing away, breaking up, disappearance, dying, death, completion of time, break up of
  the aggregates, casting off of the body, interruption in the life faculty of the various
  beings in this or that group of beings, that is called death. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is <i>sorrow</i>? Whatever sorrow,
  sorrowing, sadness, inward sorrow, inward sadness of anyone suffering from misfortune,
  touched by a painful thing, that is called sorrow. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is <i>lamentation</i>? Whatever crying,
  grieving, lamenting, weeping, wailing, lamentation of anyone suffering from misfortune,
  touched by a painful thing, that is called lamentation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is <i>pain</i>? Whatever is experienced as
  bodily pain, bodily discomfort, pain or discomfort born of bodily contact, that is called
  pain. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is <i>distress</i>? Whatever is experienced
  as mental pain, mental discomfort, pain or discomfort born of mental contact, that is
  called distress. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is <i>despair</i>? Whatever despair,
  despondency, desperation of anyone suffering from misfortune, touched by a painful thing,
  that is called despair. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is the stress of not getting what one
  wants? In beings subject to birth, the wish arises, 'O, may we not be subject to birth,
  and may birth not come to us.' But this is not be achieved by wishing. This is the stress
  of not getting what one wants. In beings subject to aging... illness... death... sorrow,
  lamentation, pain, distress, and despair, the wish arises, 'O, may we not be subject to
  aging... illness... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair, and may
  aging... illness... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair not come to
  us.' But this is not be achieved by wishing. This is the stress of not getting what one
  wants. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is the stress of association with the
  unbeloved? There is the case where undesirable, unpleasing, unattractive sights, sounds,
  aromas, flavors, or tactile sensations occur to one; or one has connection, contact,
  relationship, interaction with those who wish one ill, who wish for one's harm, who wish
  for one's discomfort, who wish one no security from the yoke. This is called the stress of
  association with the unbeloved. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is the stress of separation from the loved?
  There is the case where desirable, pleasing, attractive sights, sounds, aromas, flavors,
  or tactile sensations do not occur to one; or one has no connection, no contact, no
  relationship, no interaction with those who wish one well, who wish for one's benefit, who
  wish for one's comfort, who wish one security from the yoke, nor with one's mother,
  father, brother, sister, friends, companions, or relatives. This is called the stress of
  separation from the loved. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is the stress of not getting what is
  wanted? In beings subject to birth, the wish arises, 'O, may we not be subject to birth,
  and may birth not come to us.' But this is not be achieved by wishing. This is the stress
  of not getting what one wants. In beings subject to aging... illness... death... sorrow,
  lamentation, pain, distress, and despair, the wish arises, 'O, may we not be subject to
  aging... illness... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair, and may
  aging... illness... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair not come to
  us.' But this is not be achieved by wishing. This is the stress of not getting what is
  wanted. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what are the five aggregates for
  clinging/sustenance that, in short, are stress? Form as an aggregate for
  clinging/sustenance, feeling as an aggregate for clinging/sustenance, perception as an
  aggregate for clinging/sustenance, fabrications as an aggregate for clinging/sustenance,
  consciousness as an aggregate for clinging/sustenance: These are called the five
  aggregates for clinging/sustenance that, in short, are stress. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This is called the noble truth of stress. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>[b]</b> &quot;And what is the noble truth of the
  origination of stress? The craving that makes for further becoming -- accompanied by
  passion and delight, relishing now here and now there -- i.e., craving for sensuality,
  craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And where does this craving, when arising, arise?
  And where, when dwelling, does it dwell? Whatever is endearing and alluring in terms of
  the world: that is where this craving, when arising, arises. That is where, when dwelling,
  it dwells. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is endearing and alluring in terms of the

  Perception of ideas... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Intention for forms... Intention for sounds...
  Intention for smells... Intention for tastes... Intention for tactile sensations...
  Intention for ideas... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Craving for forms... Craving for sounds... Craving

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thought directed at forms... Thought directed at

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Evaluation of forms... Evaluation of sounds...
  Evaluation of smells... Evaluation of tastes... Evaluation of tactile sensations...
  Evaluation of ideas is endearing and alluring in terms of the world. That is where, when
  being abandoned, this craving is abandoned. That is where, when ceasing, it ceases. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This is called the noble truth of the cessation of
  stress. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>[d]</b> &quot;And what is the noble truth of the path
  of practice leading to the cessation of stress? Just this very noble eightfold path: right
  view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
  mindfulness, right concentration. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is right view? Knowledge with regard to
  stress, knowledge with regard to the origination of stress, knowledge with regard to the
  cessation of stress, knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the cessation
  of stress: This is called right view. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is right resolve? Aspiring to renunciation,
  to freedom from ill will, to harmlessness: This is called right resolve. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying,
  from divisive speech, from abusive speech, and from idle chatter: This is called right
  speech. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is right action? Abstaining from taking
  life, from stealing, and from sexual intercourse. This is called right action. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is right livelihood? There is the case
  where a noble disciple, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with
  right livelihood: This is called right livelihood. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is right effort? There is the case where a
  monk generates desire, endeavors, arouses persistence, upholds and exerts his intent for
  the sake of the non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen... for
  the sake of the abandoning of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen... for the sake
  of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen... (and) for the
  maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, and culmination of skillful
  qualities that have arisen: This is called right effort. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is right mindfulness? There is the case
  where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful --
  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on
  feelings in and of themselves... the mind in and of itself... mental qualities in and of
  themselves -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with
  reference to the world. This is called right mindfulness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is right concentration? There is the case
  where a monk -- quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental)
  qualities -- enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture and pleasure born from
  withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation. With the stilling of directed
  thought and evaluation, he enters and remains in the second jhana: rapture and pleasure
  born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation --
  internal assurance. With the fading of rapture he remains in equanimity, mindful and
  alert, physically sensitive of pleasure. He enters and remains in the third jhana, of
  which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, he has a pleasurable abiding.' With
  the abandoning of pleasure and pain -- as with the earlier disappearance of elation and
  distress -- he enters and remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity and
  mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is called right concentration. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This is called the noble truth of the path of
  practice leading to the cessation of stress. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on mental
  qualities in and of themselves, or externally on mental qualities in and of themselves, or
  both internally and externally on mental qualities in and of themselves. Or he remains
  focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to mental qualities, on the
  phenomenon of passing away with regard to mental qualities, or on the phenomenon of
  origination and passing away with regard to mental qualities. Or his mindfulness that
  'There are mental qualities' is maintained to the extent of knowledge and remembrance. And
  he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is
  how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves with reference to the
  four noble truths... </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(E. Conclusion)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now, if anyone would develop these four frames of
  reference in this way for seven years, one of two fruits can be expected for him: either
  gnosis right here and now, or -- if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance --
  non-return. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Let alone seven years. If anyone would develop these
  four frames of reference in this way for six years... five... four... three... two
  years... one year... seven months... six months... five... four... three... two months...
  one month... half a month, one of two fruits can be expected for him: either gnosis right
  here and now, or -- if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance -- non-return. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Let alone half a month. If anyone would develop
  these four frames of reference in this way for seven days, one of two fruits can be
  expected for him: either gnosis right here and now, or -- if there be any remnant of
  clinging-sustenance -- non-return. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'This is the direct path for the purification of
  beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and
  distress, for the attainment of the right method, and for the realization of Unbinding --
  in other words, the four frames of reference.' Thus was it said, and in reference to this
  was it said.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks
  delighted in the Blessed One's words. </font></p>
