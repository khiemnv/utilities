    <p><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><strong><em>Foreword</em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>The translation of the Maha-Parinibbana Sutta which is
    offered here is a work of collaboration, but is based upon a text prepared by Sister
    Vajira of Germany, to whom credit for the initial work must be given. The final revision
    of the text was done by Mr Francis Story. The notes and references which, it is hoped,
    will help in the understanding of the text have been contributed by the Venerable
    Nyanaponika Mahathera, much of the material for them being taken from the Pali Commentary.
    </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Every effort has been made to give a faithful
    rendering of the original Pali. The greater part of the sutta is straight forward
    narrative, but it also includes references to profound aspects of the Dhamma, which have
    to be understood in their precise meaning if the full import of the Buddha's last
    exhortations is to be conveyed. In the choice which inevitably arises between
    terminological exactitude and literary form, the translators have endeavoured to preserve
    the former with as little sacrifice as possible of the latter. Those who understand the
    difficulties of Pali translation will appreciate that this is no easy task, and will
    readily overlook the absence of those literary graces which only a freer rendering would
    have permitted. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>As in previous translations, some repetitions have
    been omitted and some repetitive passages condensed. </em></font></p>

    Edition</em></strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>In this revised edition of Last Days of
    the Buddha, a number of stylistic changes have been made, aimed at improved readability.
    The word &quot;Bhagava,&quot; untranslated in the original edition, has been replaced by
    &quot;the Blessed One&quot;; several archaic expressions, which gave a slightly Biblical
    flavour to the diction, have been replaced by their modern counterparts; awkward sentences
    have been reformulated; and greater consistency was aimed at in the rendering of certain
    terms and expressions. The notes have also been revised in certain respects. The titles of
    the chapters and sections have been supplied by the translator and editors, though the
    division of the work into six recitation units dates back to the period when the Canon was
    transmitted orally from one generation to the next. </em></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>* * * </em></font></p>
    <p><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Of the thirty-four discourses (suttas) that make up
    the Digha Nikaya (Collection of Long Discourses), ours, the sixteenth, is the longest, and
    so altogether maintains the first place where length is concerned. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>It preserves the principal feature of the Buddhist
    sutta, insofar as it is, like others, a rehearsal of events as they have been witnessed.
    On account of its unique composition, however, it is, more than other suttas, capable not
    only of winning the affection of the pious Buddhist, as it naturally does, but also of
    attracting the general reader, since it is indeed a fine specimen of sacred universal
    literature. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>It gives a good general idea of the Buddha's Teaching,
    too, even though it hardly offers anything that is not found -- and often more extensively
    dealt with -- in other suttas. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>At the end of his life, after almost half a century's
    ministry, the Master had long since taught all that was necessary for attaining the ideal.
    During the last period his primary concern, therefore, was to impress on his followers the
    necessity of unflinchingly putting into practice those very same teachings: an appeal that
    could, of course, hardly fail in stirring their hearts more than ever before. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>The Sangha came, indeed, to witness the greatest event
    in its history, and was keenly aware of it, especially since the Master had announced his
    Parinibbana three months ahead. The impression on the bhikkhus who flocked to him in large
    numbers as he was pressing northward was tremendous, and could not fail to be reflected
    vividly in the oral account. (The Buddhist canon was originally, as is well known,
    altogether oral.) Because of its particular import and abundance, this material was soon
    formed into one body; and so our sutta came to be. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>In this connection, it is hardly possible not to
    remember gratefully the Venerable Ananda. His share in the preservation of the Master's
    word is paramount to any other bhikkhu's, and his figure is inseparable from our texts.
    This was to become manifest for all time in the Maha-Parinibbana Sutta, which is plainly
    unimaginable without him. For it is Ananda, and again Ananda, whom the Master addresses,
    having tested for twenty-five years his sure grasp and brilliant memory and also his
    indefatigable personal devotion. But Ananda too, here more than elsewhere, by his constant
    queries, worries, and amazements, becomes without intending it a central figure beside the
    Master himself, which undoubtedly increases the attractiveness of the text. Thus, then,
    Ananda, gentle and pleasant as his name, and yet almost throughout his career incurring
    the reproach of the brethren, was immortalized along with his beloved Master, and -- as we
    may add -- along with his strange position between praise and blame, assuming mystic
    character in the third chapter. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>The third chapter, almost exclusively, is devoted to
    depicting the circumstances connected with the Master's relinquishment of life, which is
    the dramatic culmination of events. It overwhelmingly drives home the purely metaphysical
    significance of the Parinibbana, or at least ought to do so. For the Buddha neither
    succumbed to his fatal illness nor did he give way to the appeal of Mara (which is
    identical with the non-appeal of Ananda), but sovereignly let go of existence at a timely
    hour, just as forty-five years earlier, on becoming fully enlightened, he had duly taken
    upon himself the wearisome task of teaching men. This fact is most thought-provoking, and
    consistently leads to the conclusion that by his Parinibbana, indeed, the Buddha bore the
    last and highest possible testimony to his Teaching, which permits of no lingering
    inclination to self-preservation and continuance, but on the contrary reaches the highest
    exultation ending it all. The Master's Parinibbana is, therefore, the one sorrowful event
    in the history of Buddhism that turns out, in its true meaning, to be really the most
    blissful. </em></font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Part One<br>
  In Magadha</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One [<a HREF="#n1"
  NAME="1">1</a>] dwelt at <a NAME="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a>, on the hill called Vultures'
  Peak. At that time the <a NAME="aja">king</a> of <a NAME="mag">Magadha</a>, Ajatasattu,
  son of the <a NAME="videha">Videhi</a> queen, [<a HREF="#n2" NAME="2">2</a>] desired to
  wage war against the <a NAME="vajji">Vajjis</a>. He spoke in this fashion: &quot;These
  Vajjis, powerful and glorious as they are, I shall annihilate them, I shall make them
  perish, I shall utterly destroy them.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. And Ajatasattu, the king of Magadha, addressed his
  chief minister, the brahmin <a NAME="vas">Vassakara</a>, saying: &quot;Come, brahmin, go
  to the Blessed One, pay homage in my name at his feet, wish him good health, strength,
  ease, vigour, and comfort, and speak thus: 'O Lord, Ajatasattu, the king of Magadha,
  desires to wage war against the Vajjis. He has spoken in this fashion: &quot;These Vajjis,
  powerful and glorious as they are, I shall annihilate them, I shall make them perish, I
  shall utterly destroy them.&quot;' And whatever the Blessed One should answer you, keep it
  well in mind and inform me; for Tathagatas [<a HREF="#n3" NAME="3">3</a>] do not speak
  falsely.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. &quot;Very well, sire,&quot; said the brahmin Vassakara
  in assent to Ajatasattu, king of Magadha. And he ordered a large number of magnificent
  carriages to be made ready, mounted one himself, and accompanied by the rest, drove out to
  Rajagaha towards Vultures' Peak. He went by carriage as far as the carriage could go, then
  dismounting, he approached the Blessed One on foot. After exchanging courteous greetings
  with the Blessed One, together with many pleasant words, he sat down at one side and
  addressed the Blessed One thus: &quot;Venerable Gotama, Ajatasattu, the king of Magadha,
  pays homage at the feet of the Venerable Gotama and wishes him good health, strength,
  ease, vigour, and comfort. He desires to wage war against the Vajjis, and he has spoken in
  this fashion: 'These Vajjis, powerful and glorious as they are, I shall annihilate them, I
  shall make them perish, I shall utterly destroy them.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Conditions of a Nation's Welfare</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. At that time the Venerable <a NAME="ananda">Ananda</a>
  [<a HREF="#n4" NAME="4">4</a>] was standing behind the Blessed One, fanning him, and the
  Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus: &quot;What have you heard, Ananda: do the
  Vajjis have frequent gatherings, and are their meetings well attended?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I have heard, Lord, that this is so.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So long, Ananda, as this is the case, the growth of
  the Vajjis is to be expected, not their decline. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What have you heard, Ananda: do the Vajjis assemble
  and disperse peacefully and attend to their affairs in concord?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I have heard, Lord, that they do.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So long, Ananda, as this is the case, the growth of
  the Vajjis is to be expected, not their decline. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What have you heard, Ananda: do the Vajjis neither
  enact new decrees nor abolish existing ones, but proceed in accordance with their ancient
  constitutions?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I have heard, Lord, that they do.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So long, Ananda, as this is the case, the growth of
  the Vajjis is to be expected, not their decline. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What have you heard, Ananda: do the Vajjis show
  respect, honour, esteem, and veneration towards their elders and think it worthwhile to
  listen to them?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I have heard, Lord, that they do.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So long, Ananda, as this is the case, the growth of
  the Vajjis is to be expected, not their decline. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What have you heard, Ananda: do the Vajjis refrain
  from abducting women and maidens of good families and from detaining them?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I have heard, Lord, that they refrain from doing
  so.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So long, Ananda, as this is the case, the growth of
  the Vajjis is to be expected, not their decline. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What have you heard, Ananda: do the Vajjis show
  respect, honour, esteem, and veneration towards their shrines, both those within the city
  and those outside it, and do not deprive them of the due offerings as given and made to
  them formerly?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I have heard, Lord, that they do venerate their
  shrines, and that they do not deprive them of their offerings.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So long, Ananda, as this is the case, the growth of
  the Vajjis is to be expected, not their decline. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What have you heard, Ananda: do the Vajjis duly
  protect and guard the arahats, so that those who have not come to the realm yet might do
  so, and those who have already come might live there in peace?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I have heard, Lord, that they do.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So long, Ananda, as this is the case, the growth of
  the Vajjis is to be expected, not their decline.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. And the Blessed One addressed the brahmin Vassakara in
  these words: &quot;Once, brahmin, I dwelt at <a NAME="vesali">Vesali</a>, at the <a
  NAME="sarandada">Sarandada</a> shrine, and there it was that I taught the Vajjis these
  seven conditions leading to (a nation's) welfare. [<a HREF="#n5" NAME="5">5</a>] So long,
  brahmin, as these endure among the Vajjis, and the Vajjis are known for it, their growth
  is to be expected, not their decline.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thereupon the brahmin Vassakara spoke thus to the Blessed
  One: &quot;If the Vajjis, Venerable Gotama, were endowed with only one or another of these
  conditions leading to welfare, their growth would have to be expected, not their decline.
  What then of all the seven? No harm, indeed, can be done to the Vajjis in battle by
  Magadha's king, Ajatasattu, except through treachery or discord. Well, then, Venerable
  Gotama, we will take our leave, for we have much to perform, much work to do.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Do as now seems fit to you, brahmin.&quot; And the
  brahmin Vassakara, the chief minister of Magadha, approving of the Blessed One's words and
  delighted by them, rose from his seat and departed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Welfare of the Bhikkhus</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. Then, soon after Vassakara's departure, the Blessed One
  addressed the Venerable Ananda thus: &quot;Go now, Ananda, and assemble in the hall of
  audience as many bhikkhus as live around Rajagaha.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Very well, Lord.&quot; And the Venerable Ananda did
  as he was requested and informed the Blessed One: &quot;The community of bhikkhus is
  assembled, Lord. Now let the Blessed One do as he wishes.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thereupon the Blessed One rose from his seat, went up to
  the hall of audience, took his appointed seat there, and addressed the bhikkhus thus:
  &quot;Seven conditions leading to welfare I shall set forth, bhikkhus. Listen and pay heed
  to what I shall say.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected, not
  their decline, bhikkhus, so long as they assemble frequently and in large numbers; meet
  and disperse peacefully and attend to the affairs of the Sangha in concord; so long as
  they appoint no new rules, and do not abolish the existing ones, but proceed in accordance
  with the code of training (Vinaya) laid down; so long as they show respect, honour,
  esteem, and veneration towards the elder bhikkhus, those of long standing, long gone
  forth, the fathers and leaders of the Sangha, and think it worthwhile to listen to them;
  so long as they do not come under the power of the craving that leads to fresh becoming;
  so long as they cherish the forest depths for their dwellings; so long as they establish
  themselves in mindfulness, so that virtuous brethren of the Order who have not come yet
  might do so, and those already come might live in peace; so long, bhikkhus, as these seven
  conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it,
  their growth is to be expected, not their decline. </font></p>

  come under the spell of evil desires; have no bad friends, associates, or companions; and
  so long as they do not stop halfway on account of some trifling achievement. So long,

  Blessed Ones, as to their virtue, their meditation, their wisdom, their abiding, and their
  emancipation?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Not so, Lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then how is this, Sariputta? Of me, who am at
  present the Arahat, the Fully Enlightened One, do you have direct personal knowledge as to
  my virtue, my meditation, my wisdom, my abiding, and my emancipation?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Not so, Lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then it is clear, Sariputta, that you have no such
  direct personal knowledge of the Arahats, the Fully Enlightened Ones of the past, the
  future, and the present. How then dare you set forth a speech so lofty and lordly, an
  utterance so bold, a veritable sounding of the lion's roar, saying: 'This faith, Lord, I
  have in the Blessed One, that there has not been, there will not be, nor is there now
  another recluse or brahmin more exalted in Enlightenment than the Blessed One'?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">17. &quot;No such direct personal knowledge, indeed, is
  mine, Lord, of the Arahats, the Fully Enlightened Ones of the past, the future, and the
  present; and yet I have come to know the lawfulness of the Dhamma. Suppose, Lord, a king's
  frontier fortress was strongly fortified, with strong ramparts and turrets, and it had a
  single gate, and there was a gatekeeper, intelligent, experienced, and prudent, who would
  keep out the stranger but allow the friend to enter. As he patrols the path that leads all
  around the fortress, he does not perceive a hole or fissure in the ramparts even big
  enough to allow a cat to slip through. So he comes to the conclusion: 'Whatever grosser
  living things are to enter or leave this city, they will all have to do so just by this
  gate.' In the same way, Lord, I have come to know the lawfulness of the Dhamma. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;For, Lord, all the Blessed Ones, Arahats, Fully
  Enlightened Ones of the past had abandoned the five hindrances, [<a HREF="#n14" NAME="14">14</a>]
  the mental defilements that weaken wisdom; had well established their minds in the four
  foundations of mindfulness; [<a HREF="#n15" NAME="15">15</a>] had duly cultivated the
  seven factors of enlightenment, and were fully enlightened in unsurpassed, supreme
  Enlightenment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And, Lord, all the Blessed Ones, Arahats, Fully
  Enlightened Ones of the future will abandon the five hindrances, the mental defilements
  that weaken wisdom; will well establish their minds in the four foundations of
  mindfulness; will duly cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment, and will be fully
  enlightened in unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And the Blessed One too, Lord, being at present the
  Arahat, the Fully Enlightened One, has abandoned the five hindrances, the mental
  defilements that weaken wisdom; has well established his mind in the four foundations of
  mindfulness; has duly cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment, and is fully
  enlightened in unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">18. And also in Nalanda, in the mango grove of Pavarika,
  the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Such and such is virtue; such and such is
  concentration; and such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of
  concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes the fruit,
  great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration; utterly freed
  from the taints of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in
  wisdom.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">19. When the Blessed One had stayed at Nalanda as long as
  he pleased, he addressed the Venerable Ananda thus: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Come, Ananda, let us go to <a NAME="pataligama">Pataligama</a>.&quot;
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the Blessed One took up his abode at Pataligama
  together with a large community of bhikkhus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">20. Then the devotees of Pataligama came to know:
  &quot;The Blessed One, they say, has arrived at Pataligama.&quot; And they approached the
  Blessed One, respectfully greeted him, sat down at one side, and addressed him thus:
  &quot;May the Blessed One, Lord, kindly visit our council hall.&quot; And the Blessed One
  consented by his silence. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">21. Knowing the Blessed One's consent, the devotees of
  Pataligama rose from their seats, respectfully saluted him, and keeping their right sides
  towards him, departed for the council hall. Then they prepared the council hall by
  covering the floor all over, arranging seats and water, and setting out an oil lamp.
  Having done this, they returned to the Blessed One, respectfully greeted him, and standing
  at one side, announced: &quot;Lord, the council hall is ready, with the floor covered all
  over, seats and water prepared, and an oil lamp has been set out. Let the Blessed One
  come, Lord, at his convenience. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">22. And the Blessed One got ready, and taking his bowl and
  robe, went to the council hall together with the company of bhikkhus. After rinsing his
  feet, the Blessed One entered the council hall and took his seat close to the middle
  pillar, facing east. The community of bhikkhus, after rinsing their feet, also entered the
  council hall and took seats near the western wall, facing east, so that the Blessed One
  was before them. And the devotees of Pataligama, after rinsing their feet and entering the
  council hall, sat down near the eastern wall, facing west, so that the Blessed One was in
  front of them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Fruits of an Immoral and a Moral Life</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">23. Thereupon the Blessed One addressed the devotees of
  Pataligama thus: &quot;The immoral man, householders, by falling away from virtue,
  encounters five perils: great loss of wealth through heedlessness; an evil reputation; a
  timid and troubled demeanor in every society, be it that of nobles, brahmins,
  householders, or ascetics; death in bewilderment; and, at the breaking up of the body
  after death, rebirth in a realm of misery, in an unhappy state, in the nether world, in
  hell. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">24. &quot;Five blessings, householders, accrue to the
  righteous man through his practice of virtue: great increase of wealth through his
  diligence; a favorable reputation; a confident deportment, without timidity, in every
  society, be it that of nobles, brahmins, householders, or ascetics; a serene death; and,
  at the breaking up of the body after death, rebirth in a happy state, in a heavenly
  world.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">25. And the Blessed One spent much of the night
  instructing the devotees of Pataligama in the Dhamma, rousing, edifying, and gladdening
  them, after which he dismissed them, saying: &quot;The night is far advanced,
  householders. You may go at your convenience. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And the devotees of Pataligama
  rose from their seats, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and keeping their right sides
  towards him, departed. And the Blessed One, soon after their departure, retired into
  privacy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">26. At that time <a NAME="sunidha">Sunidha</a> and
  Vassakara, the chief ministers of Magadha, were building a fortress at Pataligama in
  defence against the Vajjis. And deities in large numbers, counted in thousands, had taken
  possession of sites at Pataligama. In the region where deities of great power prevailed,
  officials of great power were bent on constructing edifices; and where deities of medium
  power and lesser power prevailed, officials of medium and lesser power were bent on
  constructing edifices. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">27. And the Blessed One saw with the heavenly eye, pure
  and transcending the faculty of men, the deities, counted in thousands, where they had
  taken possession of sites in Pataligama. And rising before the night was spent, towards
  dawn, the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus: &quot;Who is it, Ananda, that
  is erecting a city at Pataligama?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sunidha and Vassakara, Lord, the chief ministers of
  Magadha, are building a fortress at Pataligama, in defence against the Vajjis.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">28. &quot;It is, Ananda, as if Sunidha and Vassakara had
  taken counsel with the gods of the Thirty-three. For I beheld, Ananda, with the heavenly
  eye, pure and transcending the faculty of men, a large number of deities, counted in
  thousands, that have taken possession of sites at Pataligama. In the region where deities
  of great power prevail, officials of great power are bent on constructing edifices; and
  where deities of medium and lesser power prevail, officials of medium and lesser power are
  bent on constructing edifices. Truly, Ananda, as far as the Aryan race extends and trade
  routes spread, this will be the foremost city <a NAME="pataliputta">Pataliputta</a>, a
  trade-centre. [<a HREF="#n16" NAME="16">16</a>] But Pataliputta, Ananda, will be assailed
  by three perils -- fire, water, and dissension.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">29. Then Sunidha and Vassakara went to the Blessed One,
  and after courteous greeting to the Blessed One, and exchanging many pleasant words, they
  stood at one side and addressed him thus: &quot;May the Venerable Gotama please accept our
  invitation for tomorrow's meal, together with the community of bhikkhus.&quot; And the
  Blessed One consented by his silence. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">30. Knowing the Blessed One's consent, Sunidha and
  Vassakara departed for their own abodes, where they had choice food, hard and soft,
  prepared. And when it was time, they announced to the Blessed One: &quot;It is time,
  Venerable Gotama; the meal is ready.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thereupon the Blessed One got ready in the forenoon, and
  taking bowl and robe, he went together with the community of bhikkhus to the abode of
  Sunidha and Vassakara, where he took the seat prepared for him. And Sunidha and Vassakara
  themselves attended on the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha, and served them
  with choice food, hard and soft. When the Blessed One had finished his meal and had
  removed his hand from the bowl, they took low seats and sat down at one side. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">31. And the Blessed One thanked them with these stanzas: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Wherever he may dwell, the prudent man<br>
    Ministers to the chaste and virtuous;<br>
    And having to these worthy ones made gifts,<br>
    He shares his merits with the local devas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And so revered, they honour him in turn,<br>
    Are gracious to him even as a mother<br>
    Is towards her own, her only son;<br>
    And he who thus enjoys the devas' grace,<br>
    And is by them beloved, good fortune sees.&quot; </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After this, the Blessed One rose from his seat and
  departed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Crossing the Ganges</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">32. Then Sunidha and Vassakara followed behind the Blessed
  One, step by step, saying: &quot;Through whichever gate the recluse Gotama will depart
  today, that we will name the Gotama-gate; and the ford by which he will cross the river
  Ganges shall be named the Gotama-ford.&quot; And so it came to pass, where the gate was
  concerned. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">33. But when the Blessed One came to the river <a
  NAME="ganges">Ganges</a>, it was full to the brim, so that crows could drink from it. And
  some people went in search of a boat or float, while others tied up a raft, because they
  desired to get across. But the Blessed One, as quickly as a strong man might stretch out
  his bent arm or draw in his outstretched arm, vanished from this side of the river Ganges,
  and came to stand on the yonder side. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">34. And the Blessed One saw the people who desired to
  cross searching for a boat or float, while others were binding rafts. And then the Blessed
  One, seeing them thus, gave forth the solemn utterance: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;They who have bridged the ocean vast,<br>
    Leaving the lowlands far behind,<br>
    While others still their frail rafts bind,<br>
    Are saved by wisdom unsurpassed.&quot; </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Part Two<br>
  The Journey to Vesali</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Four Noble Truths</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Now the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda,
  saying: &quot;Come, Ananda, let us go to <a NAME="kotigama">Kotigama</a>.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And the Blessed One took up
  his abode at Kotigama together with a large community of bhikkhus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying:
  &quot;Bhikkhus, it is through not realizing, through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths
  that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as
  well as by you. What are these four? They are the noble truth of suffering; the noble
  truth of the origin of suffering; the noble truth of the cessation of suffering; and the
  noble truth of the way to the cessation of suffering. But now, bhikkhus, that these have
  been realized and penetrated, cut off is the craving for existence, destroyed is that
  which leads to renewed becoming, and there is no fresh becoming.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Thus it was said by the Blessed One. And the Happy One,
  the Master, further said: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Through not seeing the Four Noble Truths,<br>
    Long was the weary path from birth to birth.<br>
    When these are known, removed is rebirth's cause,<br>
    The root of sorrow plucked; then ends rebirth.&quot; </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. And also at Kotigama the Blessed One often gave counsel
  to the bhikkhus thus: &quot;Such and such is virtue; such and such is concentration; and
  such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of concentration when
  it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of
  wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration; utterly freed from the taints of lust,
  becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. When the Blessed One had stayed at Kotigama as long as
  he pleased, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: &quot;Come, Ananda, let us go to <a
  NAME="nadika">Nadika</a>.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And the Blessed One took up
  his abode in Nadika together with a large community of bhikkhus, staying in the Brick
  House. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i><a NAME="4spec">The Four Specific Attainments</a></i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One
  and, after greeting him respectfully, sat down at one side. And he said to the Blessed
  One: &quot;Here in Nadika, Lord, there have passed away the bhikkhu <a NAME="salha">Salha</a>
  and the bhikkhuni <a NAME="nanda">Nanda</a>. Likewise there have passed away the layman <a
  NAME="sudatta">Sudatta</a> and the laywoman <a NAME="sujata">Sujata</a>; likewise the
  layman <a NAME="kakudha">Kakudha</a>, <a name="kalinga">Kalinga</a>, <a name="nikata">Nikata</a>,
  <a name="katissabha">Katissabha</a>, <a name="tuttha">Tuttha</a>, <a name="santuttha">Santuttha</a>,
  <a name="bhadda">Bhadda</a>, and <a NAME="laysubhadda">Subhadda</a>. What is their
  destiny, Lord? What is their future state?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. &quot;The bhikkhu Salha, Ananda, through the
  destruction of the taints in this very lifetime has attained to the taint-free deliverance
  of mind and deliverance through wisdom, having directly known and realized it by himself.
  [<a HREF="#n17" NAME="17">17</a>] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The bhikkhuni Nanda, Ananda, through the destruction
  of the five lower fetters (that bind beings to the world of the senses), has arisen
  spontaneously (among the Suddhavasa deities) and will come to final cessation in that very
  place, not liable to return from that world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The layman Sudatta, Ananda, through the destruction
  of the three fetters (self-belief, doubt, and faith in the efficacy of rituals and
  observances), and the lessening of lust, hatred, and delusion, has become a once-returner
  and is bound to make an end of suffering after having returned but once more to this
  world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The laywoman Sujata, Ananda, through the destruction
  of the three fetters has become a stream-enterer, and is safe from falling into the states
  of misery, assured, and bound for Enlightenment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The layman Kakudha, Ananda, through the destruction
  of the five lower fetters (that bind beings to the world of the senses), has arisen
  spontaneously (among the Suddhavasa deities), and will come to final cessation in that
  very place, not liable to return from that world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So it is with Kalinga, Nikata, Katissabha, Tuttha,
  Santuttha, Bhadda, and Subhadda, and with more than fifty laymen in Nadika. More than
  ninety laymen who have passed away in Nadika, Ananda, through the destruction of the three
  fetters, and the lessening of lust, hatred, and delusion, have become once-returners and
  are bound to make an end of suffering after having returned but once more to this world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;More than five hundred laymen who have passed away
  in Nadika, Ananda, through the complete destruction of the three fetters have become
  stream-enterers, and are safe from falling into the states of misery, assured, and bound
  for Enlightenment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Mirror of the Dhamma</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. &quot;<a NAME="mirror">But truly</a>, Ananda, it is
  nothing strange that human beings should die. But if each time it happens you should come
  to the Tathagata and ask about them in this manner, indeed it would be troublesome to him.
  Therefore, Ananda, I will give you the teaching called the Mirror of the Dhamma,
  possessing which the noble disciple, should he so desire, can declare of himself: 'There
  is no more rebirth for me in hell, nor as an animal or ghost, nor in any realm of woe. A
  stream-enterer am I, safe from falling into the states of misery, assured am I and bound
  for Enlightenment.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">9. &quot;And what, Ananda, is that teaching called the
  Mirror of Dhamma, possessing which the noble disciple may thus declare of himself? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In this case, Ananda, the noble disciple possesses
  unwavering faith in the Buddha thus: 'The Blessed One is an Arahat, the Fully Enlightened
  One, perfect in knowledge and conduct, the Happy One, the knower of the world, the
  paramount trainer of beings, the teacher of gods and men, the Enlightened One, the Blessed
  One.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He possesses unwavering faith in the Dhamma thus:
  'Well propounded by the Blessed One is the Dhamma, evident, timeless, [<a HREF="#n18"
  NAME="18">18</a>] inviting investigation, leading to emancipation, to be comprehended by
  the wise, each for himself.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He possesses unwavering faith in the Blessed One's
  Order of Disciples thus: 'Well faring is the Blessed One's Order of Disciples,
  righteously, wisely, and dutifully: that is to say, the four pairs of men, the eight
  classes of persons. The Blessed One's Order of Disciples is worthy of honour, of
  hospitality, of offerings, of veneration -- the supreme field for meritorious deeds in the
  world.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And he possesses virtues that are dear to the Noble
  Ones, complete and perfect, spotless and pure, which are liberating, praised by the wise,
  uninfluenced (by worldly concerns), and favorable to concentration of mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">10. &quot;This, Ananda, is the teaching called the Mirror
  of the Dhamma, whereby the noble disciple may thus know of himself: 'There is no more
  rebirth for me in hell, nor as an animal or ghost, nor in any realm of woe. A
  stream-enterer am I, safe from falling into the states of misery, assured am I and bound
  for Enlightenment.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">11. And also in Nadika, in the Brick House, the Blessed
  One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus: &quot;Such and such is virtue; such and such
  is concentration; and such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the fruit, great is the gain
  of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes the fruit,
  great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration; utterly freed
  from the taints of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in
  wisdom.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">12. When the Blessed One had stayed in Nadika as long as
  he pleased, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: &quot;Come, Ananda, let us go to
  Vesali.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, O Lord.&quot; And the Blessed One took up
  his abode in Vesali together with a large community of bhikkhus, and stayed in Ambapali's
  grove. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">13. Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying:
  &quot;Mindful should you dwell, bhikkhus, clearly comprehending; thus I exhort you. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">14. &quot;And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu mindful? When he
  dwells contemplating the body in the body, earnestly, clearly comprehending, and
  mindfully, after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world; and when he
  dwells contemplating feelings in feelings, the mind in the mind, and mental objects in
  mental objects, earnestly, clearly comprehending, and mindfully, after having overcome
  desire and sorrow in regard to the world, then is he said to be mindful. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">15. &quot;And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu have clear
  comprehension? When he remains fully aware of his coming and going, his looking forward
  and his looking away, his bending and stretching, his wearing of his robe and carrying of
  his bowl, his eating and drinking, masticating and savouring, his defecating and
  urinating, his walking, standing, sitting, lying down, going to sleep or keeping awake,
  his speaking or being silent, then is he said to have clear comprehension. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Mindful should you dwell, bhikkhus, clearly
  comprehending; thus I exhort you.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Ambapali and the Licchavis</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">16. Then <a name="ambapali">Ambapali</a> the courtesan
  came to know: &quot;The Blessed One, they say, has arrived at Vesali and is now staying in
  my Mango Grove.&quot; And she ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made
  ready, mounted one of them herself, and accompanied by the rest, drove out from Vesali
  towards her park. She went by carriage as far as the carriage could go, then alighted; and
  approaching the Blessed One on foot, she respectfully greeted him and sat down at one
  side. And the Blessed One instructed Ambapali the courtesan in the Dhamma and roused,
  edified, and gladdened her. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">17. Thereafter Ambapali the courtesan spoke to the Blessed
  One, saying: &quot;May the Blessed One, O Lord, please accept my invitation for tomorrow's
  meal, together with the community of bhikkhus.&quot; And by his silence the Blessed One
  consented. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sure, then, of the Blessed One's consent, Ambapali the
  courtesan rose from her seat, respectfully saluted him, and keeping her right side towards
  him, took her departure. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">18. Then the <a NAME="licchavis">Licchavi</a> of Vesali
  came to know: &quot;The Blessed One, they say, has arrived at Vesali and is now staying in
  Ambapali's grove.&quot; And they ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be
  made ready, each mounted one, and accompanied by the rest, drove out from Vesali. Now, of
  these Licchavis, some were in blue, with clothing and ornaments all of blue, while others
  were in yellow, red, and white. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">19. And it so happened that Ambapali the courtesan drove
  up against the young Licchavis, axle by axle, wheel by wheel, and yoke by yoke. Thereupon
  the Licchavis exclaimed: &quot;Why do you drive up against us in this fashion,
  Ambapali?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus it is, indeed, my princes, and not otherwise!
  For the Blessed One is invited by me for tomorrow's meal, together with the community of
  bhikkhus!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Give up the meal, Ambapali, for a hundred
  thousand!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But she replied: &quot;Even if you were to give me Vesali,
  sirs, together with its tributary lands, I would not give up a meal of such
  importance.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers in annoyance:
  &quot;See, friends! We are defeated by this mango lass! We are utterly outdone by this
  mango lass!&quot; But they continued on their way to Ambapali's grove. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">20. And the Blessed One beheld the Licchavis from afar, as
  they drove up. Then he spoke to the bhikkhus, saying: &quot;Those of you, bhikkhus, who
  have not yet seen the Thirty-three gods, may behold the assembly of the Licchavis, and may
  gaze on them, for they are comparable to the assembly of the Thirty-three gods.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">21. Then the Licchavis drove their carriages as far as the
  carriages could go, then alighted; and approaching the Blessed One on foot, they
  respectfully greeted him and sat down at one side. The Blessed One instructed the
  Licchavis in the Dhamma, and roused, edified, and gladdened them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">22. Thereafter the Licchavis spoke to the Blessed One,
  saying: &quot;May the Blessed One, O Lord, please accept our invitation for tomorrow's
  meal, together with the community of bhikkhus.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The invitation for tomorrow's meal, Licchavis, has
  been accepted by me from Ambapali the courtesan.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers in annoyance:
  &quot;See, friends! We are defeated by this mango lass! We are utterly outdone by this
  mango lass!&quot; And then the Licchavis, approving of the Blessed One's words and
  delighted with them, rose from their seats, respectfully saluted him, and keeping their
  right sides towards him, took their departure. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">23. Then, after the night had passed, Ambapali the
  courtesan had choice food, hard and soft, prepared in her park, and announced it to the
  Blessed One: &quot;It is time, O Lord; the meal is ready.&quot; Thereupon the Blessed One
  got ready in the forenoon, and taking bowl and robe, he went together with the community
  of bhikkhus to Ambapali's dwelling, and there he took the seat prepared for him. And
  Ambapali herself attended on the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha, and served
  them with choice food, hard and soft. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">24. And when the Blessed One had finished his meal and had
  removed his hand from his bowl, Ambapali the courtesan took a low seat, and placing
  herself at one side, spoke to the Blessed One, saying: &quot;This park, O Lord, I offer to
  the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha.&quot; And the Blessed One accepted the
  park. He then instructed Ambapali in the Dhamma, and having roused, edified, and gladdened
  her, he rose from his seat and departed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">25. And also at Vesali, in Ambapali's grove, the Blessed
  One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus: &quot;Such and such is virtue; such and such
  is concentration; and such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the fruit, great is the gain
  of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes the fruit,
  great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration; utterly freed
  from the taints of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in
  wisdom.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">26. When the Blessed One had stayed in Ambapali's grove as
  long as he pleased, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: &quot;Come, Ananda, let us
  go to the village of <a NAME="beluva">Beluva</a>.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And the Blessed One took up
  his abode in the village of Beluva together with a large community of bhikkhus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Blessed One's Deadly Sickness</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">27. At that time the Blessed One spoke to the bhikkhus,
  saying: &quot;Go now, bhikkhus, and seek shelter anywhere in the neighborhood of Vesali
  where you are welcome, among acquaintances and friends, and there spend the rainy season.
  As for me, I shall spend the rainy season in this very place, in the village of
  Beluva.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, O Lord,&quot; the bhikkhus said. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">28. <a NAME="illness">But when</a> the Blessed One had
  entered upon the rainy season, there arose in him a severe illness, and sharp and deadly
  pains came upon him. And the Blessed One endured them mindfully, clearly comprehending and
  unperturbed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">29. Then it occurred to the Blessed One: &quot;It would
  not be fitting if I came to my final passing away without addressing those who attended on
  me, without taking leave of the community of bhikkhus. Then let me suppress this illness
  by strength of will, resolve to maintain the life process, and live on.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">30. And the Blessed One suppressed the illness by strength
  of will, resolved to maintain the life process, and lived on. So it came about that the
  Blessed One's illness was allayed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">31. And the Blessed One recovered from that illness; and
  soon after his recovery he came out from his dwelling place and sat down in the shade of
  the building, on a seat prepared for him. Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed
  One, respectfully greeted him, and sitting down at one side, he spoke to the Blessed One,
  saying: &quot;Fortunate it is for me, O Lord, to see the Blessed One at ease again!
  Fortunate it is for me, O Lord, to see the Blessed One recovered! For truly, Lord, when I
  saw the Blessed One's sickness it was as though my own body became weak as a creeper,
  every thing around became dim to me, and my senses failed me. Yet, Lord, I still had some
  little comfort in the thought that the Blessed One would not come to his final passing
  away until he had given some last instructions respecting the community of bhikkhus.&quot;
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">32. Thus spoke the Venerable Ananda, but the Blessed One
  answered him, saying: &quot;What more does the community of bhikkhus expect from me,
  Ananda? I have set forth the Dhamma without making any distinction of esoteric and
  exoteric doctrine; there is nothing, Ananda, with regard to the teachings that the
  Tathagata holds to the last with the closed fist of a teacher who keeps some things back.
  Whosoever may think that it is he who should lead the community of bhikkhus, or that the
  community depends upon him, it is such a one that would have to give last instructions
  respecting them. But, Ananda, the Tathagata has no such idea as that it is he who should
  lead the community of bhikkhus, or that the community depends upon him. So what
  instructions should he have to give respecting the community of bhikkhus? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now I am frail, Ananda, old, aged, far gone in
  years. This is my eightieth year, and my life is spent. Even as an old cart, Ananda, is
  held together with much difficulty, so the body of the Tathagata is kept going only with
  supports. It is, Ananda, only when the Tathagata, disregarding external objects, with the
  cessation of certain feelings, attains to and abides in the signless concentration of
  mind, [<a HREF="#n19" NAME="19">19</a>] that his body is more comfortable. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">33. &quot;<a NAME="island">Therefore</a>, Ananda, be
  islands unto yourselves, refuges unto yourselves, seeking no external refuge; with the
  Dhamma as your island, the Dhamma as your refuge, seeking no other refuge. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And how, Ananda, is a bhikkhu an island unto
  himself, a refuge unto himself, seeking no external refuge; with the Dhamma as his island,
  the Dhamma as his refuge, seeking no other refuge? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">34. &quot;When he dwells contemplating the body in the
  body, earnestly, clearly comprehending, and mindfully, after having overcome desire and
  sorrow in regard to the world; when he dwells contemplating feelings in feelings, the mind
  in the mind, and mental objects in mental objects, earnestly, clearly comprehending, and
  mindfully, after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world, then, truly, he
  is an island unto himself, a refuge unto himself, seeking no external refuge; having the
  Dhamma as his island, the Dhamma as his refuge, seeking no other refuge. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">35. &quot;Those bhikkhus of mine, Ananda, who now or after
  I am gone, abide as an island unto themselves, as a refuge unto themselves, seeking no
  other refuge; having the Dhamma as their island and refuge, seeking no other refuge: it is
  they who will become the highest, [<a HREF="#n20" NAME="20">20</a>] if they have the
  desire to learn.&quot; </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Part Three<br>
  Relinquishing the Will to Live</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Blessed One's Prompting</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Then the Blessed One, getting ready in the forenoon,
  took bowl and robe and went into Vesali for alms. After the alms round and meal, on his
  return, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: &quot;Take up a mat, Ananda, and let us
  spend the day at the Capala shrine.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And the Venerable Ananda took
  up a mat and followed behind the Blessed One, step by step. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. And the Blessed One went to the Capala shrine and sat
  down on the seat prepared for him. And when the Venerable Ananda had seated himself at one
  side after he had respectfully saluted the Blessed One, the Lord said to him:
  &quot;Pleasant, Ananda, is Vesali; pleasant are the shrines of <a name="udena">Udena</a>, <a
  name="gotamaka">Gotamaka</a>, <a name="sattambaka">Sattambaka</a>, <a name="bahuputta">Bahuputta</a>,
  Sarandada, and <a name="capala">Capala</a>.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. And the Blessed One said: &quot;Whosoever, Ananda, has
  developed, practiced, employed, strengthened, maintained, scrutinized, and brought to
  perfection the four constituents of psychic power could, if he so desired, remain
  throughout a world-period or until the end of it. [<a HREF="#n21" NAME="21">21</a>] The
  Tathagata, Ananda, has done so. Therefore the Tathagata could, if he so desired, remain
  throughout a world-period or until the end of it.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. But the Venerable Ananda was unable to grasp the plain
  suggestion, the significant prompting, given by the Blessed One. As though his mind was
  influenced by Mara, [<a HREF="#n22" NAME="22">22</a>] he did not beseech the Blessed One:
  &quot;May the Blessed One remain, O Lord!. May the Happy One remain, O Lord, throughout
  the world-period, for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for
  the world, for the benefit, well being, and happiness of gods and men!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. And when for a second and a third time the Blessed One
  repeated his words, the Venerable Ananda remained silent. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. Then the Blessed One said to the Venerable Ananda:
  &quot;Go now, Ananda, and do as seems fit to you.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Even so, O Lord.&quot; And the Venerable Ananda,
  rising from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and keeping his right side
  towards him, took his seat under a tree some distance away. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Mara's Appeal</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. <a NAME="mara">And when</a> the Venerable Ananda had
  gone away, Mara, the Evil One, approached the Blessed One. And standing at one side he
  spoke to the Blessed One, saying: &quot;Now, O Lord, let the Blessed One come to his final
  passing away; let the Happy One utterly pass away! The time has come for the Parinibbana
  of the Lord. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;For the Blessed One, O Lord, spoke these words to
  me: 'I shall not come to my final passing away, Evil One, until my bhikkhus and
  bhikkhunis, laymen and laywomen, have come to be true disciples -- wise, well disciplined,
  apt and learned, preservers of the Dhamma, living according to the Dhamma, abiding by the
  appropriate conduct, and having learned the Master's word, are able to expound it, preach
  it, proclaim it, establish it, reveal it, explain it in detail, and make it clear; until,
  when adverse opinions arise, they shall be able to refute them thoroughly and well, and to
  preach this convincing and liberating Dhamma.' [<a HREF="#n23" NAME="23">23</a>] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. &quot;And now, O Lord, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, laymen
  and laywomen, have become the Blessed One's disciples in just this way. So, O Lord, let
  the Blessed One come to his final passing away! The time has come for the Parinibbana of
  the Lord. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;For the Blessed One, O Lord, spoke these words to
  me: 'I shall not come to my final passing away, Evil One, until this holy life taught by
  me has become successful, prosperous, far-renowned, popular, and widespread, until it is
  well proclaimed among gods and men.' And this too has come to pass in just this way. So, O
  Lord, let the Blessed One come to his final passing away, let the Happy One utterly pass
  away! The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Blessed One Relinquishes His Will to Live</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">9. When this was said, the Blessed One spoke to Mara, the
  Evil One, saying: &quot;Do not trouble yourself, Evil One. Before long the Parinibbana of
  the Tathagata will come about. Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass
  away.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">10. And at the Capala shrine the Blessed One thus
  mindfully and clearly comprehending renounced his will to live on. And upon the Lord's
  renouncing his will to live on, there came a tremendous earthquake, dreadful and
  astonishing, and thunder rolled across the heavens. And the Blessed One beheld it with
  understanding, and made this solemn utterance: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What causes life, unbounded or confined [<a
    HREF="#n24" NAME="24">24</a>] -- <br>
    His process of becoming [<a HREF="#n25" NAME="25">25</a>] -- this the Sage<br>
    Renounces. With inward calm and joy he breaks,<br>
    As though a coat of mail, his own life's cause.&quot; [<a HREF="#n26" NAME="26">26</a>] </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">11. Then it came to the mind of the Venerable Ananda:
  &quot;Marvellous it is indeed, and most wonderful! The earth shakes mightily,
  tremendously! Dreadful and astonishing it is, how the thunders roll across the heavens!
  What could be the reason, what the cause, that so mighty an earthquake should arise?&quot;
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i><a NAME="8eq">Eight Causes of Earthquakes</a></i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">12. And the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One,
  and respectfully greeting him, sat down at one side. Then he spoke to the Blessed One,
  saying: &quot;Marvellous it is indeed, and most wonderful! The earth shakes mightily,
  tremendously! Dreadful and astonishing it is how the thunders roll across the heavens!
  What could be the reason, what the cause, that so mighty an earthquake should arise?&quot;
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">13. Then the Blessed One said: &quot;There are eight
  reasons, Ananda, eight causes for a mighty earthquake to arise. What are those eight? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">14. &quot;This great earth, Ananda, is established upon
  liquid, the liquid upon the atmosphere, and the atmosphere upon space. And when, Ananda,
  mighty atmospheric disturbances take place, the liquid is agitated. And with the agitation
  of the liquid, tremors of the earth arise. This is the first reason, the first cause for
  the arising of mighty earthquakes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">15. &quot;Again, Ananda, when an ascetic or holy man of
  great power, one who has gained mastery of his mind, or a deity who is mighty and potent,
  develops intense concentration on the delimited aspect of the earth element, and to a
  boundless degree on the liquid element, he, too, causes the earth to tremble, quiver, and
  shake. This is the second reason, the second cause for the arising of mighty earthquakes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">16-21. &quot;Again, Ananda, when the Bodhisatta departs
  from the Tusita realm and descends into his mother's womb, mindfully and clearly
  comprehending; and when the Bodhisatta comes out from his mother's womb, mindfully and
  clearly comprehending; and when the Tathagata becomes fully enlightened in unsurpassed,
  supreme Enlightenment; when the Tathagata sets rolling the excellent Wheel of the Dhamma;
  when the Tathagata renounces his will to live on; and when the Tathagata comes to pass
  away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains -- then, too,
  Ananda, this great earth trembles, quivers, and shakes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;These, Ananda, are the eight reasons, the eight
  causes for a great earthquake to arise. [<a HREF="#n27" NAME="27">27</a>] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i><a NAME="8assem">Eight Assemblies</a></i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">22. &quot;Now there are eight kinds of assemblies, Ananda,
  that is to say, assemblies of nobles, brahmins, householders, ascetics, of the Four Great
  Kings, of the Thirty-three gods, of Maras, and of Brahmas. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">23. &quot;And I recall, Ananda, how I have attended each
  of these eight kinds of assemblies, amounting to hundreds. [<a HREF="#n28" NAME="28">28</a>]
  And before seating myself and starting the conversation or the discussion, I made my
  appearance resemble theirs, my voice resemble theirs. And so I taught them the Dhamma, and
  roused, edified, and gladdened them. Yet while I was speaking to them thus, they did not
  know me, and they would enquire of one another, asking: 'Who is he that speaks to us? Is
  it a man or a god?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then having taught them the Dhamma, and roused,
  edified, and gladdened them, I would straightaway vanish. And when I had vanished, too,
  they did not know me, and they would enquire of one another, asking: 'Who is he that has
  vanished? Is it a man or a god?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And such, Ananda, are the eight kinds of assemblies.

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">52. Then the Blessed One said: &quot;Do you have faith,
  Ananda, in the Enlightenment of the Tathagata?&quot; And the Venerable Ananda replied:
  &quot;Yes, O Lord, I do.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then how, Ananda, can you persist against the
  Tathagata even up to the third time?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">53. Then the Venerable Ananda said: &quot;This, O Lord, I
  have heard and learned from the Blessed One himself when the Blessed One said to me:
  'Whosoever, Ananda, has developed, practiced, employed, strengthened, maintained,
  scrutinized, and brought to perfection the four constituents of psychic power could, if he
  so desired, remain throughout a world-period or until the end of it. The Tathagata,
  Ananda, has done so. Therefore the Tathagata could, if he so desired, remain throughout a
  world-period or until the end of it.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">54. &quot;And did you believe it, Ananda?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, O Lord, I did.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then, Ananda, the fault is yours. Herein have you
  failed, inasmuch as you were unable to grasp the plain suggestion, the significant
  prompting given by the Tathagata, and you did not then entreat the Tathagata to remain.
  For if you had done so, Ananda, twice the Tathagata might have declined, but the third
  time he would have consented. Therefore, Ananda, the fault is yours; herein have you
  failed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">55. &quot;At Rajagaha, Ananda, when dwelling at Vultures'
  Peak, I spoke to you, saying: 'Pleasant, Ananda, is Rajagaha; pleasant is Vultures' Peak.
  Whosoever, Ananda, has developed ... Therefore the Tathagata could, if he so desired,
  remain throughout a world-period or until the end of it.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">56. &quot;So also at the Banyan Grove, at Robbers' Cliff,
  at the <a NAME="sattapanni">Sattapanni</a> Cave on the <a name="vebhara">Vebhara</a>
  Mountain, at the Black Rock of <a name="isigili">Isigili</a>, at the Serpents' Pool in the
  Cool Forest, at the <a name="tapoda">Tapoda</a> Grove, at the Bamboo Grove in the
  Squirrels' Feeding-ground, at Jivaka's Mango Grove, and at Small Nook in the Deer Park I
  spoke to you in the same words, saying: 'Pleasant, Ananda, is Rajagaha, pleasant are these
  places. Whosoever, Ananda, has developed ... Therefore the Tathagata could, if he so
  desired, remain throughout a world-period or until the end of it.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But you, Ananda, were unable to grasp the plain
  suggestion, the significant prompting given you by the Tathagata, and you did not entreat
  the Tathagata to remain. For if you had done so, Ananda, twice the Tathagata might have
  declined, but the third time he would have consented. Therefore, Ananda, the fault is
  yours; herein you have failed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">57. &quot;So also at Vesali, Ananda, at different times
  the Tathagata has spoken to you, saying: 'Pleasant, Ananda, is Vesali; pleasant are the
  shrines of Udena, Gotamaka, Sattambaka, Bahuputta, Sarandada, and Capala. Whosoever,
  Ananda, has developed ... Therefore the Tathagata could, if he so desired, remain
  throughout a world-period or until the end of it.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But you, Ananda, were unable to grasp the plain
  suggestion, the significant prompting, given you by the Tathagata, and you did not entreat
  the Tathagata to remain. For if you had done so, Ananda, twice the Tathagata might have
  declined, but the third time he would have consented. Therefore, Ananda, the fault is
  yours; herein you have failed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">58. &quot;Yet, Ananda, have I not taught from the very
  beginning that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change, separation, and
  severance? Of that which is born, come into being, is compounded and subject to decay, how
  can one say: 'May it not come to dissolution!' There can be no such state of things. And
  of that, Ananda, which the Tathagata has finished with, that which he has relinquished,
  given up, abandoned, and rejected -- his will to live on -- the Tathagata's word has been
  spoken once for all: 'Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come about. Three
  months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away.' And that the Tathagata should withdraw
  his words for the sake of living on -- this is an impossibility. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Last Admonition</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">59. &quot;So, then, Ananda, let us go to the hall of the
  Gabled House, in the Great Forest.&quot; And the Venerable Ananda replied: &quot;So be it,
  Lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">60. Then the Blessed One, with the Venerable Ananda, went
  to the hall of the Gabled House, in the Great Forest. And there he spoke to the Venerable
  Ananda, saying: &quot;Go now, Ananda, and assemble in the hall of audience all the
  bhikkhus who dwell in the neighborhood of Vesali.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And the Venerable Ananda
  gathered all the bhikkhus who dwelt in the neighborhood of Vesali, and assembled them in
  the hall of audience. And then, respectfully saluting the Blessed One, and standing at one
  side, he said: &quot;The community of bhikkhus is assembled, Lord. Now let the Blessed One
  do as he wishes.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">61. Thereupon the Blessed One entered the hall of
  audience, and taking the seat prepared for him, he exhorted the bhikkhus, saying:
  &quot;Now, O bhikkhus, I say to you that these teachings of which I have direct knowledge
  and which I have made known to you -- these you should thoroughly learn, cultivate,
  develop, and frequently practise, that the life of purity may be established and may long
  endure, for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world,
  for the benefit, well being, and happiness of gods and men. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">62. &quot;And what, bhikkhus, are these teachings? They
  are the four foundations of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four constituents of
  psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of enlightenment,
  and the Noble Eightfold Path. These, bhikkhus, are the teachings of which I have direct
  knowledge, which I have made known to you, and which you should thoroughly learn,
  cultivate, develop, and frequently practise, that the life of purity may be established
  and may long endure, for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for
  the world, for the benefit, well being, and happiness of gods and men.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">63. Then the Blessed One said to the bhikkhus: &quot;So,
  bhikkhus, I exhort you: All compounded things are subject to vanish. Strive with
  earnestness. The time of the Tathagata's Parinibbana is near. Three months hence the
  Tathagata will utterly pass away.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">64. And having spoken these words, the Happy One, the
  Master, spoke again, saying: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;My years are now full ripe, the life span left is
    short.<br>
    Departing, I go hence from you, relying on myself alone.<br>
    Be earnest, then, O bhikkhus, be mindful and of<br>
    virtue pure! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With firm resolve, guard your own mind!<br>
    Whoso untiringly pursues the Dhamma and the Discipline<br>
    Shall go beyond the round of births and make an end of suffering.&quot; </font></p>

  <h4 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Part Four<br>
  The Last Meal</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Elephant's Look</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Then the Blessed One, getting ready in the forenoon,
  took bowl and robe and went into Vesali for alms. After the alms round and meal, on his
  return, he looked upon Vesali with the elephant's look, [<a HREF="#n36" NAME="36">36</a>]
  and said to the Venerable Ananda: &quot;This, Ananda, is the last time that the Tathagata
  will look upon Vesali. Come, Ananda, let us go to <a name="bhandagama">Bhandagama</a>.&quot;
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, O Lord.&quot; And the Blessed One took up
  his abode at Bhandagama together with a large community of bhikkhus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying:
  &quot;Bhikkhus, it is through not realizing, through not penetrating four principles that
  this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as
  by you. What are those four? They are: noble virtue, noble concentration, noble wisdom,
  and noble emancipation. But now, bhikkhus, that these have been realized and penetrated,
  cut off is the craving for existence, destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming,
  and there is no fresh becoming.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. And having spoken these words, the Happy One, the
  Master, spoke again, saying: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Virtue, concentration, wisdom, and emancipation
  unsurpassed -- </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are the principles realized by Gotama the renowned; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And, knowing them, he, the Buddha, to his monks has taught
  the Dhamma. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He, the destroyer of suffering, the Master, the Seer, is
  at peace.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. And also at Bhandagama the Blessed One often gave
  counsel to the bhikkhus thus: &quot;Such and such is virtue; such and such is
  concentration; and such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of
  concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes the fruit,
  great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration; utterly freed
  from the taints of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in
  wisdom.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. When the Blessed One had stayed at Bhandagama as long
  as he pleased, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda: &quot;Come, Ananda, let us go to <a
  name="hatthigama">Hatthigama</a>.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And the Blessed One took up
  his abode at Hatthigama together with a large community of bhikkhus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And when the Blessed One had stayed at Hatthigama as long
  as he pleased, he took up his abode at Ambagama, then at Jambugama. And at each of these
  places the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus: &quot;Such and such is
  virtue; such and such is concentration; and such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the
  fruit, great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct;
  great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by
  concentration; utterly freed from the taints of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind
  that is fully developed in wisdom.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. And when the Blessed One had stayed at Jambugama as
  long as he pleased, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda: &quot;Come, Ananda, let us go to <a
  name="bhoganagara">Bhoganagara</a>.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And the Blessed One took up
  his abode at Bhoganagara together with a large community of bhikkhus, and stayed in the
  Ananda shrine. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i><a NAME="4ref">The Four Great References</a></i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. And there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus,
  saying: &quot;Now, bhikkhus, I shall make known to you the four great references. [<a
  HREF="#n37" NAME="37">37</a>] Listen and pay heed to my words.&quot; And those bhikkhus
  answered, saying: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">8-11. Then the Blessed One said: &quot;In this fashion,
  bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might speak: 'Face to face with the Blessed One, brethren, I have
  heard and learned thus: This is the Dhamma and the Discipline, the Master's Dispensation';
  or: 'In an abode of such and such a name lives a community with elders and a chief. Face
  to face with that community, I have heard and learned thus: This is the Dhamma and the
  Discipline, the Master's Dispensation'; or: 'In an abode of such and such a name live
  several bhikkhus who are elders, who are learned, who have accomplished their course, who
  are preservers of the Dhamma, the Discipline, and the Summaries. Face to face with those
  elders, I have heard and learned thus: This is the Dhamma and the Discipline, the Master's
  Dispensation'; or: 'In an abode of such and such a name lives a single bhikkhu who is an
  elder, who is learned, who has accomplished his course, who is a preserver of the Dhamma,
  the Discipline, and the Summaries. Face to face with that elder, I have heard and learned
  thus: This is the Dhamma and the Discipline, the Master's Dispensation.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In such a case, bhikkhus, the declaration of such a
  bhikkhu is neither to be received with approval nor with scorn. Without approval and
  without scorn, but carefully studying the sentences word by word, one should trace them in
  the Discourses and verify them by the Discipline. If they are neither traceable in the
  Discourses nor verifiable by the Discipline, one must conclude thus: 'Certainly, this is
  not the Blessed One's utterance; this has been misunderstood by that bhikkhu -- or by that
  community, or by those elders, or by that elder.' In that way, bhikkhus, you should reject
  it. But if the sentences concerned are traceable in the Discourses and verifiable by the
  Discipline, then one must conclude thus: 'Certainly, this is the Blessed One's utterance;
  this has been well understood by that bhikkhu -- or by that community, or by those elders,
  or by that elder.' And in that way, bhikkhus, you may accept it on the first, second,
  third, or fourth reference. These, bhikkhus, are the four great references for you to
  preserve.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">12. And also at Bhoganagara, at the Ananda shrine, the
  Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus: &quot;Such and such is virtue; such
  and such is concentration; and such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the fruit, great is
  the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes
  the fruit, great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration;
  utterly freed from the taints of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully
  developed in wisdom.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">13. When the Blessed One had stayed at Bhoganagara as long
  as he pleased, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: &quot;Come, Ananda, let us go to <a
  NAME="pava">Pava</a>.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And the Blessed One took up
  his abode at Pava together with a great community of bhikkhus, and stayed in the Mango
  Grove of Cunda, who was by family a metalworker. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Buddha's Last Meal </i></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">14. And <a NAME="cunda">Cunda</a> the metalworker came to
  know: &quot;The Blessed One, they say, has arrived at Pava, and is staying in my Mango
  Grove.&quot; And he went to the Blessed One, and having respectfully greeted him, sat down
  at one side. And the Blessed One instructed Cunda the metalworker in the Dhamma, and
  roused, edified, and gladdened him. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">15. Then Cunda spoke to the Blessed One, saying: &quot;May
  the Blessed One, O Lord, please accept my invitation for tomorrow's meal, together with
  the community of bhikkhus.&quot; And by his silence the Blessed One consented. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">16. Sure, then, of the Blessed One's consent, Cunda the
  metalworker rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and keeping his
  right side towards him, took his departure. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">17. And Cunda the metalworker, after the night had passed,
  had choice food, hard and soft, prepared in his abode, together with a quantity of <i>sukara-maddava,</i>
  [<a HREF="#n38" NAME="38">38</a>] and announced it to the Blessed One, saying: &quot;It is
  time, O Lord, the meal is ready.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">18. Thereupon the Blessed One, in the forenoon, having got
  ready, took bowl and robe and went with the community of bhikkhus to the house of Cunda,
  and there sat down on the seat prepared for him. And he spoke to Cunda, saying: &quot;With
  the <i>sukara-maddava</i> you have prepared, Cunda, you may serve me; with the other food,
  hard and soft, you may serve the community of bhikkhus.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And with the <i>sukara-maddava</i>
  prepared by him, he served the Blessed One; and with the other food, hard and soft, he
  served the community of bhikkhus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">19. Thereafter the Blessed One spoke to Cunda, saying:
  &quot;Whatever, Cunda, is left over of the <i>sukara-maddava,</i> bury that in a pit. For
  I do not see in all this world, with its gods, Maras, and Brahmas, among the host of
  ascetics and brahmins, gods and men, anyone who could eat it and entirely digest it except
  the Tathagata alone.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And Cunda the metalworker answered the Blessed One saying:
  &quot;So be it, O Lord.&quot;And what remained over of the <i>sukara-maddava</i> he buried
  in a pit. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">20. Then he returned to the Blessed One, respectfully
  greeted him, and sat down at one side. And the Blessed One instructed Cunda the
  metalworker in the Dhamma, and roused, edified, and gladdened him. After this he rose from
  his seat and departed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">21. And soon after the Blessed One had eaten the meal
  provided by Cunda the metalworker, a dire sickness fell upon him, even dysentery, and he
  suffered sharp and deadly pains. But the Blessed One endured them mindfully, clearly
  comprehending and unperturbed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">22. Then the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda,
  saying: &quot;Come, Ananda, let us go to <a NAME="kusinara">Kusinara</a>.&quot; And the
  Venerable Ananda answered: &quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">23. When he had eaten Cunda's food, I heard,<br>
    With fortitude the deadly pains he bore.<br>
    From the <i>sukara-maddava</i> a sore<br>
    And dreadful sickness came upon the Lord.<br>
    But nature's pangs he endured. &quot;Come, let us go<br>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Clearing of the Waters</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">24. Now on the way the Blessed One went aside from the
  highway and stopped at the foot of a tree. And he said to the Venerable Ananda:
  &quot;Please fold my upper robe in four, Ananda, and lay it down. I am weary and want to
  rest awhile.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And the Venerable Ananda
  folded the robe in four and laid it down. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">25. And the Blessed One sat down on the seat prepared for
  him and said to the Venerable Ananda: &quot;Please bring me some water, Ananda. I am
  thirsty and want to drink.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">26. And the Venerable Ananda answered the Blessed One:
  &quot;But just now, Lord, a great number of carts, five hundred carts, have passed over,
  and the shallow water has been cut through by the wheels, so that it flows turbid and
  muddy. But the Kakuttha River, Lord, is quite close by, and its waters are clear,
  pleasant, cool, and translucent. It is easily approachable and delightfully placed. There
  the Blessed One can quench his thirst and refresh his limbs.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">27-29. But a second time the Blessed One made his request,
  and the Venerable Ananda answered him as before. And then for a third time the Blessed One
  said: &quot;Please bring me some water, Ananda. I am thirsty and want to drink.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">30. Then the Venerable Ananda answered, saying: &quot;So
  be it, Lord.&quot; And he took the bowl and went to the stream. And the shallow water,
  which had been cut through by the wheels so that it flowed turbid and muddy, became clear
  and settled down, pure and pleasant as the Venerable Ananda drew near. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">31. Then the Venerable Ananda thought: &quot;Marvellous
  and most wonderful indeed is the power and glory of the Tathagata!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">32. And he took up water in the bowl and carried it to the
  Blessed One, and said: &quot;Marvellous and most wonderful indeed is the power and glory
  of the Tathagata! For this shallow water, which had been cut through by the wheels so that
  it flowed turbid and muddy, became clear and settled down, pure and pleasant as I drew
  near. Now let the Blessed One drink the water. Let the Happy One drink.&quot; And the
  Blessed One drank the water. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Pukkusa the Malla</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">33. Now it so happened that one <a NAME="pukkusa">Pukkusa</a>
  of the <a NAME="malla">Malla</a> clan, who was a disciple of <a NAME="alara">Alara Kalama</a>,
  was passing by on his way from Kusinara to Pava.[<a HREF="#n40" NAME="40">40</a>] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">34. And when he saw the Blessed One seated at the foot of
  a tree, he approached him, respectfully greeted him, and sat down at one side. And he
  spoke to the Blessed One, saying: &quot;Marvellous it is, Lord, most wonderful it is, O
  Lord, the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">35. &quot;For at one time, Lord, Alara Kalama was on a
  journey, and he went aside from the highway and sat down by the wayside at the foot of a
  tree to pass the heat of the day. And it came about, Lord, that a great number of carts,
  even five hundred carts, passed by him, one by one. And then, Lord, a certain man who was
  following behind that train of carts, approached and spoke to him, saying: 'Did you, sir,
  see a great number of carts that passed you by?' And Alara Kalama answered him: 'I did not
  see them, brother.' 'But the noise, sir, surely you heard?' 'I did not hear it, brother.'
  Then that man asked him: 'Then, sir, perhaps you slept?' 'No, brother, I was not
  sleeping.' 'Then, sir, were you conscious?' 'I was, brother.' Then that man said: 'Then,
  sir, while conscious and awake you still did not see the great number of carts, even five
  hundred carts, that passed you by one after another, nor heard the noise? Why, sir, your
  very robe is covered with their dust!' And Alara Kalama replied, saying: 'So it is,
  brother.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">36. &quot;And to that man, O Lord, came the thought:
  'Marvellous it is, most wonderful indeed it is, the state of calmness wherein abide those
  who have gone forth from the world!' And there arose in him great faith in Alara Kalama,
  and he went his way.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">37. &quot;Now what do you think, Pukkusa? What is more
  difficult to do, more difficult to meet with -- that a man, while conscious and awake,
  should not see a great number of carts, even five hundred carts, that passed him by one
  after another, nor hear the noise, or that one conscious and awake, in the midst of a
  heavy rain, with thunder rolling, lightning flashing, and thunderbolts crashing, should
  neither see it nor hear the noise?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">38. &quot;What, O Lord, are five hundred carts -- nay,
  six, seven, eight, nine hundred, or a thousand or even hundreds of thousands of carts --
  compared with this?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">39. &quot;Now one time, Pukkusa, I was staying at Atuma,
  and had my abode in a barn there. And at that time there was a heavy rain, with thunder
  rolling, lightning flashing, and thunderbolts crashing. And two farmers who were brothers
  were killed close to the barn, together with four oxen, and a great crowd came forth from
  Atuma to the spot where they were killed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">40. &quot;Now at that time, Pukkusa, I had come out of the
  barn and was walking up and down in thought before the door. And a certain man from the
  great crowd approached me, respectfully greeted me, and stood at one side. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">41. &quot;And I asked him: 'Why, brother, has this great
  crowd gathered together?' And he answered me: 'Just now, Lord, there was a heavy rain,
  with thunder rolling, lightning flashing, and thunderbolts crashing. And two farmers who
  were brothers were killed close by, together with four oxen. It is because of this that
  the great crowd has gathered. But where, Lord, were you?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'I was here, brother.' 'Yet, Lord, did you not see
  it?' 'I did not see it, brother.' 'But the noise, Lord, you surely heard?' 'I did not hear
  it, brother.' Then that man asked me: 'Then, Lord, perhaps you slept?' 'No, brother, I was
  not sleeping.' 'Then, Lord, you were conscious?' 'I was, brother.' Then that man said:
  'Then, Lord, while conscious and awake, in the midst of a heavy rain, with thunder
  rolling, lightning flashing, and thunderbolts crashing, you neither saw it nor heard the
  noise?' And I answered him, saying: 'I did not, brother.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">42. &quot;And to that man, Pukkusa, came the thought:
  'Marvellous it is, most wonderful indeed it is, the state of calmness wherein abide those
  who have gone forth from the world!' And there arose in him great faith in me, and he
  respectfully saluted me, and keeping his right side towards me, he went his way.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">43. When this had been said, Pukkusa of the Malla clan
  said to the Blessed One: &quot;The faith, Lord, that I had in Alara Kalama I now scatter
  to the mighty wind, I let it be carried away as by a flowing stream! Excellent, O Lord,
  most excellent, O Lord! It is as if, Lord, one were to set upright what had been
  overthrown, or to reveal what had been hidden, or to show the path to one who had gone
  astray, or to light a lamp in the darkness so that those having eyes might see -- even so
  has the Blessed One set forth the Dhamma in many ways. And so, O Lord, I take my refuge in
  the Blessed One, the Dhamma, and the Community of Bhikkhus. May the Blessed One accept me
  as his disciple, one who has taken refuge until the end of life.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">44. Then Pukkusa of the Malla clan spoke to a certain man,
  saying: &quot;Bring me at once, friend, two sets of golden-hued robes, burnished and ready
  for wear.&quot; And the man answered him: &quot;So be it, sir.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">45. And when the robes were brought, Pukkusa of the Malla
  clan offered them to the Blessed One, saying: &quot;May the Blessed One, O Lord, out of
  compassion, accept this from me.&quot; And the Blessed One said: &quot;Robe me, then in
  one, Pukkusa, and in the other robe Ananda.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And he thereupon robed the
  Blessed One in one, and in the other he robed the Venerable Ananda. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">46. And then the Blessed One instructed Pukkusa of the
  Malla clan in the Dhamma, and roused, edified, and gladdened him. And after that, Pukkusa
  rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and keeping his right side
  towards him, went his way. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">47. And soon after Pukkusa of the Malla clan had departed,
  the Venerable Ananda arranged the set of golden-hued robes, burnished and ready for wear,
  about the body of the Blessed One. But when the set of robes was arranged upon the body of
  the Blessed One, it became as though faded, and its splendor dimmed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">48. And the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One:
  &quot;Marvellous it is, O Lord, most wonderful indeed it is, how clear and radiant the
  skin of the Tathagata appears! This set of golden-hued robes, burnished and ready for
  wear, Lord, now that it is arranged upon the body of the Blessed One seems to have become
  faded, its splendor dimmed.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">49. &quot;It is so, Ananda. There are two occasions,
  Ananda, when the skin of the Tathagata appears exceedingly clear and radiant. Which are
  these two? The night, Ananda, when the Tathagata becomes fully enlightened in unsurpassed,
  supreme Enlightenment, and the night when the Tathagata comes to his final passing away
  into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains. These, Ananda, are the
  two occasions on which the skin of the Tathagata appears exceedingly clear and radiant. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">50. &quot;And now today, in the last watch of this very
  night, Ananda, in the Mallas' Sala Grove, in the vicinity of Kusinara, between two sala
  trees, the Tathagata will come to his Parinibbana. So now, Ananda, let us go to the <a
  name="kakuttha">Kakuttha</a> River.&quot; </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">51. Clad in Pukkusa's gift, the robes of gold,<br>
    The Master's form was radiant to behold. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>At the Kakuttha River</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">52. Then the Blessed One went to the Kakuttha River
  together with a great community of bhikkhus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">53. And he went down into the water and bathed and drank.
  And coming forth from the water again, he went to the Mango Grove, and there spoke to the <a
  NAME="cundaka">Venerable Cundaka</a>, saying: &quot;Please fold my upper robe in four,
  Cundaka, and lay it down. I am weary and would rest awhile.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And Cundaka folded the robe in
  four and laid it down. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">54. And the Blessed One lay down on his right side, in the
  lion's posture, resting one foot upon the other, and so disposed himself, mindfully and
  clearly comprehending, with the time for rising held in mind. And the Venerable Cundaka
  sat down right in front of the Blessed One. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">55. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha to Kakuttha's river came,<br>
    Where cool and limpid flows the pleasant stream;<br>
    There washed in water clear his weary frame<br>
    The Buddha -- he in all the world supreme!<br>
    And having bathed and drank, the Teacher straight<br>
    Crossed over, the bhikkhus thronging in his wake. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Discoursing holy truths, the Master great<br>
    Towards the Mango Grove his path did take.<br>
    There to the elder Cundaka he spoke:<br>
    &quot;Lay down my robe, please, folded into four.&quot;<br>
    Then the elder, swift as lightning stroke,<br>
    Hastened the Teacher's bidding to obey.<br>
    Weary, the Lord then lay down on the mat,<br>
    And Cunda on the ground before him sat. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <b><i><p><font face="Times New Roman">Relieving Cunda's Remorse</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">56. Then the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda,
  saying: &quot;It may come to pass, Ananda, that someone will cause remorse to Cunda the
  metalworker, saying: 'It is no gain to you, friend Cunda, but a loss, that it was from you
  the Tathagata took his last alms meal, and then came to his end.' Then, Ananda, the
  remorse of Cunda should be dispelled after this manner: 'It is a gain to you, friend
  Cunda, a blessing that the Tathagata took his last alms meal from you, and then came to
  his end. For, friend, face to face with the Blessed One I have heard and learned:
  &quot;There are two offerings of food which are of equal fruition, of equal outcome,
  exceeding in grandeur the fruition and result of any other offerings of food. Which two?
  The one partaken of by the Tathagata before becoming fully enlightened in unsurpassed,
  supreme Enlightenment; and the one partaken of by the Tathagata before passing into the
  state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains. By his deed the worthy Cunda has
  accumulated merit which makes for long life, beauty, well being, glory, heavenly rebirth,
  and sovereignty.&quot;' Thus, Ananda, the remorse of Cunda the metalworker should be
  dispelled.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">57. Then the Blessed One, understanding that matter,
  breathed forth the solemn utterance: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Who gives, his virtues shall increase;<br>
    Who is self-curbed, no hatred bears;<br>
    Whoso is skilled in virtue, evil shuns,<br>
    And by the rooting out of lust and hate<br>
    And all delusion, comes to be at peace.&quot; </font></p>

  <h4 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Part Five<br>
  At Kusinara</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Last Place of Rest</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda,
  saying: &quot;Come, Ananda, let us cross to the farther bank of the <a NAME="hirannavati">Hira&ntilde;&ntilde;avati</a>,
  and go to the Mallas' Sala Grove, in the vicinity of Kusinara.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. And the Blessed One, together with a large company of
  bhikkhus, went to the further bank of the river Hira&ntilde;&ntilde;avati, to the Sala Grove of the
  Mallas, in the vicinity of Kusinara. And there he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. &quot;Please, Ananda, prepare for me a couch between
  the twin sala trees, with the head to the north. I am weary, Ananda, and want to lie
  down.&quot;[<a HREF="#n41" NAME="41">41</a>] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And the Venerable Ananda did
  as the Blessed One asked him to do. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Blessed One lay down on his right side, in the
  lion's posture, resting one foot upon the other, and so disposed himself, mindfully and
  clearly comprehending. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. At that time the twin sala trees broke out in full
  bloom, though it was not the season of flowering. And the blossoms rained upon the body of
  the Tathagata and dropped and scattered and were strewn upon it in worship of the
  Tathagata. And celestial <i>mandarava</i> flowers and heavenly sandalwood powder from the
  sky rained down upon the body of the Tathagata, and dropped and scattered and were strewn
  upon it in worship of the Tathagata. And the sound of heavenly voices and heavenly
  instruments made music in the air out of reverence for the Tathagata. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. And the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda,
  saying: &quot;Ananda, the twin sala trees are in full bloom, though it is not the season
  of flowering. And the blossoms rain upon the body of the Tathagata and drop and scatter
  and are strewn upon it in worship of the Tathagata. And celestial coral flowers and
  heavenly sandalwood powder from the sky rain down upon the body of the Tathagata, and drop
  and scatter and are strewn upon it in worship of the Tathagata. And the sound of heavenly
  voices and heavenly instruments makes music in the air out of reverence for the Tathagata.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. &quot;Yet it is not thus, Ananda, that the Tathagata is
  respected, venerated, esteemed, worshipped, and honoured in the highest degree. But,
  Ananda, whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni, layman or laywoman, abides by the Dhamma, lives
  uprightly in the Dhamma, walks in the way of the Dhamma, it is by such a one that the
  Tathagata is respected, venerated, esteemed, worshipped, and honoured in the highest
  degree. Therefore, Ananda, thus should you train yourselves: 'We shall abide by the
  Dhamma, live uprightly in the Dhamma, walk in the way of the Dhamma.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Grief of the Gods</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. At that time the <a NAME="upavana">Venerable Upavana</a>
  was standing before the Blessed One, fanning him. And the Blessed One rebuked him, saying:
  &quot;Move aside, bhikkhu, do not stand in front of me.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. And to the Venerable Ananda came the thought:
  &quot;This Venerable Upavana has been in attendance on the Blessed One for a long time,
  closely associating with him and serving him. Yet now, right at the end, the Blessed One
  rebukes him. What now could be the reason, what the cause for the Blessed One to rebuke
  the Venerable Upavana, saying: 'Move aside, bhikkhu, do not stand in front of me'?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">9-10. And the Venerable Ananda told his thought to the
  Blessed One. The Blessed One said: &quot;Throughout the tenfold world-system, Ananda,
  there are hardly any of the deities that have not gathered together to look upon the
  Tathagata. For a distance of twelve yojanas around the Sala Grove of the Mallas in the
  vicinity of Kusinara there is not a spot that could be pricked with the tip of a hair that
  is not filled with powerful deities. And these deities, Ananda, are complaining: 'From
  afar have we come to look upon the Tathagata. For rare in the world is the arising of
  Tathagatas, Arahats, Fully Enlightened Ones. And this day, in the last watch of the night,
  the Tathagata's Parinibbana will come about. But this bhikkhu of great powers has placed
  himself right in front of the Blessed One, concealing him, so that now, at the very end,
  we are prevented from looking upon him.' Thus, Ananda, the deities complain.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">11. &quot;Of what kind of deities, Lord, is the Blessed
  One aware?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">12-13. &quot;There are deities, Ananda, in space and on
  earth, who are earthly-minded; with dishevelled hair they weep, with uplifted arms they
  weep; flinging themselves on the ground, they roll from side to side, lamenting: 'Too soon
  has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon has the Happy One come to his
  Parinibbana! Too soon will the Eye of the World vanish from sight!' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">14. &quot;But those deities who are freed from passion,
  mindful and comprehending, reflect in this way: 'Impermanent are all compounded things.
  How could this be otherwise?'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Ananda's Concern</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">15. &quot;Formerly, Lord, on leaving their quarters after
  the rains, the bhikkhus would set forth to see the Tathagata, and to us there was the gain
  and benefit of receiving and associating with those very revered bhikkhus who came to have
  audience with the Blessed One and to wait upon him. But, Lord, after the Blessed One has
  gone, we shall no longer have that gain and benefit.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i><a NAME="4pil">Four Places of Pilgrimage</a></i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">16. &quot;There are four places, Ananda, that a pious

  What are the four? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">17. &quot;'Here the Tathagata was born!'[<a HREF="#n43"

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">18. &quot;'Here the Tathagata became fully enlightened in
  unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment!'[<a HREF="#n44" NAME="44">44</a>] This, Ananda, is a
  place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">19. &quot;'Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled
  Wheel of the Dhamma!'[<a HREF="#n45" NAME="45">45</a>] This, Ananda, is a place that a
  pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">20. &quot;'Here the Tathagata passed away into the state
  of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains!' This, Ananda, is a place that a pious
  person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">21. &quot;These, Ananda, are the four places that a pious
  person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence. And truly there will come to
  these places, Ananda, pious bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, laymen and laywomen, reflecting:
  'Here the Tathagata was born! Here the Tathagata became fully enlightened in unsurpassed,
  supreme Enlightenment! Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled Wheel of the Dhamma!
  Here the Tathagata passed away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging
  remains!' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">22. &quot;And whoever, Ananda, should die on such a
  pilgrimage with his heart established in faith, at the breaking up of the body, after
  death, will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">23. Then the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One:
  &quot;How, Lord, should we conduct ourselves towards women?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Do not see them, Ananda.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But, Lord, if we do see them?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Do not speak, Ananda.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But, Lord, if they should speak to us?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then, Ananda, you should establish
  mindfulness.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">24. Then the Venerable Ananda said: &quot;How should we
  act, Lord, respecting the body of the Tathagata?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Do not hinder yourselves, Ananda, to honour the body
  of the Tathagata. Rather you should strive, Ananda, and be zealous on your own behalf,[<a
  HREF="#n46" NAME="46">46</a>] for your own good. Unflinchingly, ardently, and resolutely
  you should apply yourselves to your own good. For there are, Ananda, wise nobles, wise
  brahmins, and wise householders who are devoted to the Tathagata, and it is they who will
  render the honour to the body of the Tathagata.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">25. Then the Venerable Ananda said: &quot;But how, Lord,
  should they act respecting the body of the Tathagata?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;After the same manner, Ananda, as towards the body
  of a universal monarch.&quot;[<a HREF="#n47" NAME="47">47</a>] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But how, Lord, do they act respecting the body of a
  universal monarch?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">26. &quot;The body of a universal monarch, Ananda, is
  first wrapped round with new linen, and then with teased cotton wool, and so it is done up
  to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool. When that is done, the
  body of the universal monarch is placed in an iron[<a HREF="#n48" NAME="48">48</a>] oil
  vessel, which is enclosed in another iron vessel, a funeral pyre is built of all kinds of
  perfumed woods, and so the body of the universal monarch is burned; and at a crossroads a
  stupa is raised for the universal monarch. So it is done, Ananda, with the body of a
  universal monarch. And even, Ananda, as with the body of a universal monarch, so should it
  be done with the body of the Tathagata; and at a crossroads also a stupa should be raised
  for the Tathagata. And whosoever shall bring to that place garlands or incense or
  sandalpaste, or pay reverence, and whose mind becomes calm there -- it will be to his well
  being and happiness for a long time. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">27. &quot;There are <a NAME="4stupa">four persons</a>,
  Ananda, who are worthy of a stupa. Who are those four? A Tathagata, an Arahat, a Fully
  Enlightened One is worthy of a stupa; so also is a Paccekabuddha,[<a HREF="#n49" NAME="49">49</a>]
  and a disciple of a Tathagata, and a universal monarch. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">28-31. &quot;And why, Ananda, is a Tathagata, an Arahat, a
  Fully Enlightened One worthy of a stupa? Because, Ananda, at the thought: 'This is the
  stupa of that Blessed One, Arahat, Fully Enlightened One!' the hearts of many people will
  be calmed and made happy; and so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein,
  at the breaking up of the body, after death, they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly
  happiness. And so also at the thought: 'This is the stupa of that Paccekabuddha!' or 'This
  is the stupa of a disciple of that Tathagata, Arahat, Fully Enlightened One!' or 'This is
  the stupa of that righteous monarch who ruled according to Dhamma!' -- the hearts of many
  people are calmed and made happy; and so calmed and with their minds established in faith
  therein, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they will be reborn in a realm of
  heavenly happiness. And it is because of this, Ananda, that these four persons are worthy
  of a stupa.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Ananda's Grief</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">32. Then the Venerable Ananda went into the vihara[<a
  HREF="#n50" NAME="50">50</a>] and leaned against the doorpost and wept: &quot;I am still
  but a learner,[<a HREF="#n51" NAME="51">51</a>] and still have to strive for my own
  perfection. But, alas, my Master, who was so compassionate towards me, is about to pass
  away!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">33. And the Blessed One spoke to the bhikkhus, saying:
  &quot;Where, bhikkhus, is Ananda?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The Venerable Ananda, Lord, has gone into the vihara
  and there stands leaning against the door post and weeping: 'I am still but a learner, and
  still have to strive for my own perfection. But, alas, my Master, who was so compassionate
  towards me, is about to pass away!'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">34. Then the Blessed One asked a certain bhikkhu to bring
  the Venerable Ananda to him, saying: &quot;Go, bhikkhu, and say to Ananda, 'Friend Ananda,
  the Master calls you.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And that bhikkhu went and
  spoke to the Venerable Ananda as the Blessed One had asked him to. And the Venerable
  Ananda went to the Blessed One, bowed down to him, and sat down on one side. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">35. Then the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda,
  saying: &quot;Enough, Ananda! Do not grieve, do not lament! For have I not taught from the
  very beginning that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change, separation,
  and severence? Of that which is born, come into being, compounded, and subject to decay,
  how can one say: 'May it not come to dissolution!'? There can be no such state of things.
  Now for a long time, Ananda, you have served the Tathagata with loving-kindness in deed,
  word, and thought, graciously, pleasantly, with a whole heart and beyond measure. Great
  good have you gathered, Ananda! Now you should put forth energy, and soon you too will be
  free from the taints.&quot;[<a HREF="#n52" NAME="52">52</a>] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Praise of Ananda</i></b> </font></p>

  &quot;Bhikkhus, the Blessed Ones, Arahats, Fully Enlightened Ones of times past also had
  excellent and devoted attendant bhikkhus, such as I have in Ananda. And so also, bhikkhus,
  will the Blessed Ones, Arahats, Fully Enlightened Ones of times to come. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">37. &quot;Capable and judicious is Ananda, bhikkhus, for
  he knows the proper time for bhikkhus to have audience with the Tathagata, and the time

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Past Glory of Kusinara</i></b> </font></p>

  the Blessed One, saying: &quot;Let it not be, Lord, that the Blessed One should pass away
  in this mean place, this uncivilized township in the midst of the jungle, a mere outpost
  of the province. There are great cities, Lord, such as <a NAME="campa">Campa</a>,
  Rajagaha, <a NAME="savatthi">Savatthi</a>, <a NAME="saketa">Saketa</a>, <a NAME="kosambi">Kosambi</a>,

  one of those. For in those cities dwell many wealthy nobles and brahmins and householders
  who are devotees of the Tathagata, and they will render due honour to the remains of the

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">42. &quot;Do not say that, Ananda! Do not say: 'This mean
  place, this uncivilized township in the midst of the jungle, a mere outpost of the

  in security, and who was endowed with the seven jewels.[<a HREF="#n53" NAME="53">53</a>]
  And that King Maha Sudassana, Ananda, had his royal residence here at Kusinara, which was

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">44. &quot;Kusavati, Ananda, resounded unceasingly day and

  failed to see him at the end!&quot;'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; And the Venerable Ananda
  prepared himself, and taking bowl and robe, went with a companion to Kusinara. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">46. Now at that time the Mallas had gathered in the
  council hall for some public business. And the Venerable Ananda approached them and
  announced: &quot;Today, Vasetthas, in the last watch of the night, the Tathagata's
  Parinibbana will take place. Approach, Vasetthas, draw near! Do not be remorseful later at
  the thought: 'In our township it was that the Tathagata's Parinibbana took place, but we
  failed to see him at the end.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">47. When they heard the Venerable Ananda speak these
  words, the Mallas with their sons, their wives, and the wives of their sons, were sorely
  grieved, grieved at heart and afflicted; and some, with their hair all dishevelled, with
  arms uplifted in despair, wept; flinging themselves on the ground, they rolled from side
  to side, lamenting: &quot;Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon
  has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon will the Eye of the World vanish from
  sight!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">48. And thus afflicted and filled with grief, the Mallas,
  with their sons, their wives, and the wives of their sons, went to the Sala Grove, the
  recreation park of the Mallas, to the place where the Venerable Ananda was. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">49. And the thought arose in the Venerable Ananda:
  &quot;If I were to allow the Mallas of Kusinara to pay reverence to the Blessed One one by
  one, the night will have given place to dawn before they are all presented to him.
  Therefore let me divide them up according to clan, each family in a group, and so present
  them to the Blessed One thus: 'The Malla of such and such a name, Lord, with his wives and
  children, his attendants and his friends, pays homage at the feet of the Blessed
  One.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">50. And the Venerable Ananda divided the Mallas up
  according to clan, each family in a group, and presented them to the Blessed One. So it
  was that the Venerable Ananda caused the Mallas of Kusinara to be presented to the Blessed
  One by clans, each family in a group, even in the first watch of the night. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Last Convert</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">51. Now at that time a wandering ascetic named <a
  NAME="subbhada">Subhadda</a> was dwelling at Kusinara. And Subhadda the wandering ascetic
  heard it said: &quot;Today in the third watch of the night, the Parinibbana of the ascetic
  Gotama will take place.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">52. And the thought arose in him: &quot;I have heard it
  said by old and venerable wandering ascetics, teachers of teachers, that the arising of
  Tathagatas, Arahats, Fully Enlightened Ones, is rare in the world. Yet this very day, in
  the last watch of the night, the Parinibbana of the ascetic Gotama will take place. Now
  there is in me a doubt; but to this extent I have faith in the ascetic Gotama, that he
  could so teach me the Dhamma as to remove that doubt.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">53. Then the wandering ascetic Subhadda went to the Sala
  Grove, the recreation park of the Mallas, and drew near to the Venerable Ananda, and told
  the Venerable Ananda his thought. And he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying:
  &quot;Friend Ananda, it would be good if I could be allowed into the presence of the
  ascetic Gotama.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">54. But the Venerable Ananda answered him, saying:
  &quot;Enough, friend Subhadda! Do not trouble the Tathagata. The Blessed One is
  weary.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">55-56. Yet a second and a third time the wandering ascetic
  Subhadda made his request, and a second and a third time the Venerable Ananda refused him.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">57. And the Blessed One heard the talk between them, and
  he called the Venerable Ananda and said: &quot;Stop, Ananda! Do not refuse Subhadda.
  Subhadda, Ananda, may be allowed into the presence of the Tathagata. For whatever he will
  ask me, he will ask for the sake of knowledge, and not as an offence. And the answer I
  give him, that he will readily understand.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">58. Thereupon the Venerable Ananda said to the wandering
  ascetic Subhadda: &quot;Go then, friend Subhadda, the Blessed One gives you leave.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">59. Then the wandering ascetic Subhadda approached the
  Blessed One and saluted him courteously. And having exchanged with him pleasant and civil
  greetings, the wandering ascetic Subhadda seated himself at one side and addressed the
  Blessed One, saying: &quot;There are, Venerable Gotama, ascetics and brahmins who are
  heads of great companies of disciples, who have large retinues, who are leaders of
  schools, well known and renowned, and held in high esteem by the multitude, such teachers
  as <a NAME="purana">Purana Kassapa</a>, <a NAME="makkhali">Makkhali Gosala</a>, <a
  NAME="ajita">Ajita Kesakambali</a>, <a NAME="pakudha">Pakudha Kaccayana</a>, <a

  all of these attained realization, as each of them would have it believed, or has none of
  them, or is it that some have attained realization and others not?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">60. &quot;Enough, Subhadda! Let it be as it may, whether
  all of them have attained realization, as each of them would have it believed, or whether
  none of them has, or whether some have attained realization and others not. I will teach
  you the Dhamma, Subhadda; listen and heed it well, and I will speak.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Lion's Roar</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">61. And the Blessed One spoke, saying: &quot;In whatsoever

  there found a true ascetic of the first, second, third, or fourth degree of saintliness.
  But in whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline there is found the Noble Eightfold Path, there is
  found a true ascetic of the first, second, third, and fourth degrees of saintliness.[<a
  HREF="#n54" NAME="54">54</a>] Now in this Dhamma and Discipline, Subhadda, is found the
  Noble Eightfold Path; and in it alone are also found true ascetics of the first, second,
  third, and fourth degrees of saintliness. Devoid of true ascetics are the systems of other
  teachers. But if, Subhadda, the bhikkhus live righteously, the world will not be destitute
  of arahats. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">62. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In age but twenty-nine was I, Subhadda,<br>
    When I renounced the world to seek the Good;<br>
    Fifty-one years have passed since then, Subhadda,<br>

    In the domain of virtue and of truth,<br>
    And except therein, there is no saint<br>
    (of the first degree). </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And there is none of the second degree, nor of the

  systems of other teachers. But if, Subhadda, the bhikkhus live righteously, the world will
  not be destitute of arahats.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">63. When this was said, the wandering ascetic Subhadda
  spoke to the Blessed One, saying: &quot;<a NAME="magnif">Excellent</a>, O Lord, most
  excellent, O Lord! It is as if, Lord, one were to set upright what had been overthrown, or
  to reveal what had been hidden, or to show the path to one who had gone astray, or to
  light a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see -- even so has the Blessed
  One set forth the Dhamma in many ways. And so, O Lord, I take my refuge in the Blessed
  One, the Dhamma, and the Community of Bhikkhus. May I receive from the Blessed One
  admission to the Order and also the higher ordination.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">64. &quot;Whoever, Subhadda, having been formerly a
  follower of another creed, wishes to receive admission and higher ordination in this
  Dhamma and Discipline, remains on probation for a period of four months. At the end of
  those four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him, they grant him admission and
  higher ordination as a bhikkhu. Yet in this matter I recognize differences of
  personalities.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">65. &quot;If, O Lord, whoever, having been formerly a
  follower of another creed, wishes to receive admission and higher ordination in this

  those four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him, they grant him admission and
  higher ordination as a bhikkhu -- then I will remain on probation for a period of four
  years. And at the end of those four years, if the bhikkhus are satisfied with me, let them
  grant me admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhu.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">66. But the Blessed One called the Venerable Ananda and
  said to him: &quot;Ananda, let Subhadda be given admission into the Order.&quot; And the
  Venerable Ananda replied: &quot;So be it, Lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">67. Then the wandering ascetic Subhadda said to the
  Venerable Ananda: &quot;It is a gain to you, friend Ananda, a blessing, that in the
  presence of the Master himself you have received the sprinkling of ordination as a
  disciple.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">68. <a NAME="ordain">So it</a> came about that the
  wandering ascetic Subhadda, in the presence of the Blessed One, received admission and
  higher ordination. And from the time of his ordination the Venerable Subhadda remained
  alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute. <a NAME="victory">And before</a> long he
  attained to the goal for which a worthy man goes forth rightly from home to homelessness,
  the supreme goal of the holy life; and having by himself realized it with higher
  knowledge, he dwelt therein. He knew: &quot;Destroyed is birth; the higher life is
  fulfilled; nothing more is to be done, and beyond this life nothing more remains.&quot;
  And the Venerable Subhadda became yet another among the arahats, and he was the last
  disciple converted by the Blessed One himself. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The Blessed One's Final Exhortation</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Now the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda,
  saying: &quot;It may be, Ananda, that to some among you the thought will come: 'Ended is
  the word of the Master; we have a Master no longer.' But it should not, Ananda, be so
  considered. For that which I have proclaimed and made known as the Dhamma and the
  Discipline, that shall be your Master when I am gone. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. &quot;And, Ananda, whereas now the bhikkhus address one
  another as 'friend,' let it not be so when I am gone. The senior bhikkhus, Ananda, may
  address the junior ones by their name, their family name, or as 'friend'; but the junior
  bhikkhus should address the senior ones as 'venerable sir' or 'your reverence.'[<a

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But what, Lord, is the higher penalty?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The bhikkhu Channa, Ananda, may say what he will,
  but the bhikkhus should neither converse with him, nor exhort him, nor admonish him.&quot;
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying:
  &quot;It may be, bhikkhus, that one of you is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha, the
  Dhamma, or the Sangha, the path or the practice. Then question, bhikkhus! Do not be given
  to remorse later on with the thought: 'The Master was with us face to face, yet face to
  face we failed to ask him.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. But when this was said, the bhikkhus were silent. And
  yet a second and a third time the Blessed One said to them: &quot;It may be, bhikkhus,
  that one of you is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha, the
  path or the practice. Then question, bhikkhus! Do not be given to remorse later on with

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And for a second and a third time the bhikkhus were

  the Master that you ask no questions. Then, bhikkhus, let friend communicate it to
  friend.&quot; Yet still the bhikkhus were silent. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. And the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One,
  saying: &quot;Marvellous it is, O Lord, most wonderful it is! This faith I have in the

  Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha, the path or the practice.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Out of faith, Ananda, you speak thus. But here,
  Ananda, the Tathagata knows for certain that among this community of bhikkhus there is not
  even one bhikkhu who is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the
  Sangha, the path or the practice. For, Ananda, among these five hundred bhikkhus even the
  lowest is a stream-enterer, secure from downfall, assured, and bound for

  it down. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">24. Then the Mallas of Kusinara spoke to the Venerable
  Ananda, saying: &quot;How should we act, Venerable Ananda, respecting the body of the
  Tathagata?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;After the same manner, Vasetthas, as towards the
  body of a universal monarch.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But how, venerable Ananda, do they act respecting
  the body of a universal monarch?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The body of a universal monarch, Vasetthas, is first
  wrapped round with new linen, and then with teased cotton wool. And again it is wrapped
  round with new linen, and again with teased cotton wool, and so it is done up to five
  hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool. When that is done, the body of
  the universal monarch is placed in an iron oil-vessel, which is enclosed in another iron
  vessel and a funeral pyre is built of all kinds of perfumed woods, and so the body of the
  universal monarch is burned. And at a crossroads a stupa is raised for the universal
  monarch. So it is done, Vasetthas, with the body of a universal monarch. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And even, Vasetthas, as with the body of a universal
  monarch, so should it be done with the body of the Tathagata; and at a crossroads also a
  stupa should be raised for the Tathagata. And whoever shall bring to that place garlands
  or incense or sandalwood paste, or pay reverence, and whose mind becomes calm there -- it
  will be to his well being and happiness for a long time.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">25. Then the Mallas gave orders to their men, saying:
  &quot;Gather now all the teased cotton wool of the Mallas!&quot; And the Mallas of
  Kusinara wrapped the body of the Blessed One round with new linen, and then with teased
  cotton wool. And again they wrapped it round with new linen, and again with teased cotton
  wool, and so it was done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton
  wool. When that was done, they placed the body of the Blessed One in an iron oil-vessel,
  which was enclosed in another iron vessel, and they built a funeral pyre of all kinds of
  perfumed woods, and upon it they laid the body of the Blessed One. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">26. Now at that time the <a NAME="kassapa">Venerable Maha
  Kassapa</a>[<a HREF="#n63" NAME="63">63</a>] was journeying from Pava to Kusinara together
  with a large company of five hundred bhikkhus. And on the way, the Venerable Maha Kassapa
  went aside from the highway and sat down at the foot of a tree. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And a certain Ajivaka came by, on his way to Pava, and he
  had taken a <i>mandarava</i> flower from Kusinara. And the Venerable Maha Kassapa saw the
  Ajivaka coming from a distance, and as he drew close he spoke to him, saying: &quot;Do you
  know, friend, anything of our Master?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, friend, I know. It is now seven days since the
  ascetic Gotama passed away. From there I have brought this <i>mandarava</i> flower.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">27. Thereupon some bhikkhus, not yet freed from passion,
  lifted up their arms and wept; and some, flinging themselves on the ground, rolled from
  side to side and wept, lamenting: &quot;Too soon has the Blessed One come to his
  Parinibbana! Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon has the Eye of
  the World vanished from sight!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">28. Now at that time, one <a NAME="subhadda2">Subhadda</a>,
  who had renounced only in his old age, was seated in the assembly.[<a HREF="#n64"
  NAME="64">64</a>] And he addressed the bhikkhus, saying: &quot;Enough, friends! Do not
  grieve, do not lament! We are well rid of that great ascetic. Too long, friends, have we
  been oppressed by his saying: 'This is fitting for you; that is not fitting for you.' Now
  we shall be able to do as we wish, and what we do not wish, that we shall not do.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the Venerable Maha Kassapa addressed the bhikkhus,
  saying: &quot;Enough friends! Do not grieve, do not lament! For has not the Blessed One
  declared that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change, separation, and
  severance? Of that which is born, come into being, compounded, and subject to decay, how
  can one say: 'May it not come to dissolution!'?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">29. Now at that time four Mallas of the foremost families,
  bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes, with the thought: &quot;We
  will set alight the Blessed One's pyre,&quot; tried to do so but they could not. And the
  Mallas spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha, saying: &quot;What is the cause, Venerable
  Anuruddha, what is the reason that these four Mallas of the foremost families, bathed from
  the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes, with the thought: &quot;We will set
  alight the Blessed One's pyre,' try to do so but cannot?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You, Vasetthas, have one purpose, the deities have
  another.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then what, venerable sir, is the purpose of the
  deities?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The purpose of the deities, Vasetthas, is this: 'The
  Venerable Maha Kassapa is on his way from Pava to Kusinara together with a large company
  of five hundred bhikkhus. Let not the Blessed One's pyre be set alight until the Venerable
  Maha Kassapa has paid homage at the feet of the Blessed One.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;As the deities wish, venerable sir, so let it
  be.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">30. And the Venerable Maha Kassapa approached the pyre of
  the Blessed One, at the cetiya of the Mallas, Makuta-bandhana, in Kusinara. And he
  arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and with his clasped hands raised in salutation,
  he walked three times round the pyre, keeping his right side towards the Blessed One's
  body, and he paid homage at the feet of the Blessed One. And even so did the five hundred
  bhikkhus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And when homage had been paid by the Venerable Maha
  Kassapa and the five hundred bhikkhus, the pyre of the Blessed One burst into flame by
  itself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">31. And it came about that when the body of the Blessed
  One had been burned, no ashes or particles were to be seen of what had been skin, tissue,
  flesh, sinews, and fluid; only bones remained. Just as when ghee or oil is burned, it
  leaves no particles or ashes behind, even so when the body of the Blessed One had been
  burned, no ashes or particles were to be seen of what had been skin, tissue, flesh,
  sinews, and fluid; only bones remained. And of the five hundred linen wrappings, only two
  were not consumed, the innermost and the outermost. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">32. And when the body of the Blessed One had been burned,
  water rained down from heaven and extinguished the pyre of the Blessed One, and from the
  sala trees water came forth, and the Mallas of Kusinara brought water scented with many
  kinds of perfumes, and they too extinguished the pyre of the Blessed One. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the Mallas of Kusinara laid the relics of the Blessed
  One in their council hall, and surrounded them with a lattice-work of spears and encircled
  them with a fence of bows; and there for seven days they paid homage to the relics of the
  Blessed One with dance, song, music, flower-garlands, and perfume, and showed respect,
  honour, and veneration to the relics of the Blessed One. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">38. And the <a NAME="vethadipa">Vethadipa</a> brahmin came

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the brahmin Dona said to the assembly: &quot;So be it,

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><a NAME="n23">23</a>.</b> &quot;Convincing and
  liberating.&quot; This stands for the one Pali word <i>sappatihariya,</i> an attempt to
  render the two connotations which the word has according to the commentaries and in the
  context of other occurrences in the Canon. The commentaries derive it from the verb <i>patiharati,</i>
  &quot;to remove,&quot; and explain it as (1) the removal of what is adverse, e.g.
  opposition and objections (covered by &quot;convincing&quot;), and (2) the removal of
  inner obstructions, i.e. defilements such as greed, etc., effected by arahatship. It is
  probably to point to that latter meaning that the commentary to our present text
  paraphrases our passage as follows: &quot;until they are able to preach the Teaching in

  remainder of his life span, but he spoke to him about other eight-term groups beginning

  boars. In the latter meaning, the term has been thought to refer to a mushroom or truffle,
  or a yam or tuber. K.E. Neumann, in the preface to his German translation of the Majjhima
  Nikaya, quotes from an Indian compendium of medicinal plants, the <i>Rajanigantu,</i>
  several plants beginning with <i>sukara.</i> </font></p>

  of soft boiled rice cooked with the five cow-products; (3) a kind of alchemistic elixir <i>(rasayanavidhi).</i>
