  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Translator's Introduction</strong></em></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>This discourse is an interesting example of the
    folklore of the Pali Canon. It shows that the tendency of Asian popular Buddhism to regard
    the Buddha as a protective figure, and not just as a teacher, has its roots in the
    earliest part of the tradition. Metrical analysis indicates that the long
    &quot;tribute&quot; section of this discourse is very old, while the verses in the
    introductory section -- which is also found in the Samyutta Nikaya -- are later in form.
    This fits with a more subjective judgment: that the tribute was an earlier composition --
    in the honorific style of the ancient court bards -- to which the introduction was added
    later. This judgment is based on the fact that the two sections do not quite fit each
    other. The introduction to the tribute indicates that the reciter of the tribute is the
    Buddha himself, whereas the narration in the tribute indicates otherwise. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>At any rate, this discourse is the closest thing in
    the Pali Canon to a &quot;who's who&quot; of the deva worlds, and should provide useful
    material for anyone interested in the cosmology of early Buddhism. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>The Commentary reports the belief that the devas enjoy
    hearing this discourse chanted in Pali. Until recently it was part of many monks' standard
    memorized repertoire, to be chanted at weddings and the dedication of new buildings. Even
    today, as many of the traditions of memorization in Asia seem to be falling by the
    wayside, there are a few monks and laypeople who chant this discourse regularly. </em></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr align="center" width="25%">
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font> have heard that on one occasion
  the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood, together
  with a large Sangha of approximately five hundred bhikkhus, all of them arahants. And most
  of the devatas from ten world-systems had gathered in order to see the Blessed One and the
  Bhikkhu Sangha. Then the thought occurred to four devatas of the ranks from the Pure
  Abodes: &quot;The Blessed One is dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great
  Wood, together with a large Sangha of about five hundred bhikkhus, all of them arahants.
  And most of the devatas from ten world-systems have gathered in order to see the Blessed
  One and the Bhikkhu Sangha. Let us also approach the Blessed One and, on arrival, let us
  each speak a verse in his presence.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or
  flex his extended arm, those devatas disappeared from among the devas of the Pure Abodes
  and reappeared before the Blessed One. Having paid homage to the Blessed One, they stood
  to one side. As they were standing there, one devata recited this verse in the Blessed
  One's presence: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A great meeting in the woods:<br>
    The deva hosts have assembled.<br>
    We have come to this Dhamma meeting<br>
    To see the invincible Sangha. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then another devata recited this verse in the Blessed
  One's presence: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhus there are concentrated,<br>
    Have straightened their own minds.<br>
    Like a charioteer holding the reins,<br>
    The wise ones guard their faculties. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then another devata recited this verse in the Blessed
  One's presence: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having cut through barrenness, cut the cross-bar,<br>
    Having uprooted Indra's pillar, unstirred,<br>
    They wander about pure, unstained,<br>
    Young nagas well tamed by the One with Vision. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then another devata recited this verse in the Blessed
  One's presence: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who have gone to the Buddha for refuge<br>
    Will not go to the plane of woe.<br>
    On discarding the human body,<br>
    They will fill the hosts of the devas. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: &quot;Monks,
  most of the devatas from ten world-systems have gathered in order to see the Tathagata and
  the Bhikkhu Sangha. Those who, in the past, were Pure Ones, Rightly Self-awakened, at most
  had their devata-gathering like mine at the present. Those who, in the future, will be
  Pure Ones, Rightly Self-awakened, will at most have their devata-gathering like mine at
  the present. I will detail for you the names of the deva hosts. I will describe to you the
  names of the deva hosts. I will teach you the names of the deva hosts. Listen and pay
  close attention. I will speak.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;As you say, lord,&quot; the monks replied. The
  Blessed One said: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I recite a verse of tribute.<br>
    Those who live where spirits dwell,<br>
    who live in mountain caves,<br>
    resolute, concentrated,<br>
    many, like hidden lions,<br>
    who have overcome horripilation,<br>
    white-hearted, pure,<br>
    serene, and undisturbed:<br>
    Knowing that more than 500 of them<br>
    had come to the forest of Kapilavatthu,<br>
    the Teacher then said to them,<br>
    disciples delighting in his instruction,<br>
    &quot;The deva hosts have approached.<br>
    Detect them, monks!&quot;<br>
    Listening to the Awakened One's instruction,<br>
    they made a diligent effort.<br>
    Knowledge appeared to them,<br>
    vision of non-human beings.<br>
    Some saw 100, some 1,000, some 70,000,<br>
    some had vision of 100,000 non-human beings.<br>
    Some gained vision of innumerable devas<br>
    filling every direction.<br>
    Realizing all this,<br>
    the One-with-Vision felt moved to speak.<br>
    The Teacher then said to them,<br>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These 60 deva groups, all of varied hue,<br>
    have come arranged in order,<br>
    together with others in like manner<br>
    [thinking:]<br>
    'We'll see him who has transcended birth,<br>

    1,000 Brahma worlds,<br>
    who arose there spontaneously, effulgent:<br>
    Prestigious is he, with a terrifying body.<br>

    Don't let anyone at all escape!&quot;<br>
    Thus the great war-lord urged on his dark army,<br>
    slapping the ground with his hand,<br>
    making a horrendous din, as when<br>
    a storm cloud bursts with thunder,<br>
    lightening, and torrents of rain.<br>
    But then he withdrew-enraged,<br>
    with none under his sway.<br>
    Realizing all this,<br>
    the One-with-Vision felt moved to speak.<br>
    The Teacher then said to them,<br>
    disciples delighting in his instruction,<br>
    &quot;Mara's army has approached.<br>
    Detect them, monks!&quot;<br>
    Listening to the Awakened One's instruction,<br>
    they made a diligent effort.<br>
    The army retreated<br>
    from those without passion,<br>
    without raising even a hair on their bodies.<br>
    Having all won the battle<br>
    -- prestigious, past fear -- <br>
    they rejoice with all beings:<br>
    Disciples outstanding among the human race. </font></p>
