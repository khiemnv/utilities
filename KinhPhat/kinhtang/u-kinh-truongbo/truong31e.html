  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>hus have I heard: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion the Exalted One was dwelling in the Bamboo
  Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary, near <a name="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a>. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now at that time, young <a name="sigala">Sigala</a>, a
  householder's son, rising early in the morning, departing from Rajagaha, with wet clothes
  and wet hair, worshipped with joined hands the various quarters -- the East, the South,
  the West, the North, the Nadir, and the Zenith. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Exalted One, having robed himself in the forenoon
  took bowl and robe, and entered Rajagaha for alms. Now he saw young Sigala worshipping
  thus and spoke to him as follows: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Wherefore do you, young householder, rising early in
  the morning, departing from Rajagaha, with wet clothes and wet hair, worship, with joined
  hands these various quarters -- the East, the South, the West, the North, the Nadir, and
  the Zenith?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;My father, Lord, while dying, said to me: The six
  quarters, dear son, you shall worship. And I, Lord, respecting, revering, reverencing and
  honouring my father's word, rise early in the morning, and leaving Rajagaha, with wet
  clothes and wet hair, worship with joined hands, these six quarters.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It is not thus, young householder, the six quarters
  should be worshipped in the discipline of the noble.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;How then, Lord, should the six quarters be
  worshipped in the discipline of the noble? It is well, Lord, if the Exalted One would
  teach the doctrine to me showing how the six quarters should be worshipped in the
  discipline of the noble.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, young householder, listen and bear it well in
  mind; I shall speak.&quot; -- &quot;Very good, Lord,&quot; responded young Sigala. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the Exalted One spoke as follows: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Inasmuch, young householder, as the noble disciple <b>(1)</b>
  has eradicated the four vices in conduct,[<a href="#n1" name="1">1</a>] <b>(2)</b>
  inasmuch as he commits no evil action in four ways, <b>(3)</b> inasmuch as he pursues not
  the six channels for dissipating wealth, he thus, avoiding these fourteen evil things,
  covers the six quarters, and enters the path leading to victory in both worlds: he is
  favoured in this world and in the world beyond. Upon the dissolution of the body, after
  death, he is born in a happy heavenly realm. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(1)</b> &quot;What are <a name="4vices">the four vices</a>
  in conduct that he has eradicated? The destruction of life, householder, is a vice and so
  are stealing, sexual misconduct, and lying. These are the four vices that he has
  eradicated.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus
  spoken, he spoke yet again: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Killing, stealing, lying and adultery,<br>
    These four evils the wise never praise. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(2)</b> &quot;In which four ways does one commit no
  evil action? Led by desire does one commit evil. Led by anger does one commit evil. Led by
  ignorance does one commit evil. Led by fear does one commit evil.[<a href="#n2" name="2">2</a>]
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But inasmuch as the noble disciple is not led by
  desire, anger, ignorance, and fear, he commits no evil.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus
  spoken, he spoke yet again: </font></p>

    Or ignorance should transgress the Dhamma,<br>
    All his glory fades away<br>
    Like the moon during the waning half.<br>
    Whoever through desire, hate or fear,<br>
    Or ignorance never transgresses the Dhamma,<br>
    All his glory ever increases<br>
    Like the moon during the waxing half. </font></p>

    (iv) his word is not relied upon in a court of law,<br>
    (v) he is despised by his friends and associates,<br>

    fit to look after a wife. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(e)</b> &quot;There are, young householder, these six

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Living in this way, he leaves many duties undone,
  new wealth he does not get, and wealth he has acquired dwindles away.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus
  spoken, he spoke yet again: </font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<a name="waning">Who plays</a> with dice and drinks
  intoxicants, goes to women who are dear unto others as their own lives, associates with
  the mean and not with elders -- he declines just as the moon during the waning half. </font></p>

  drinking, frequents the bars, sinks in debt as a stone in water, swiftly brings disrepute
  to his family. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Who by habit sleeps by day, and keeps late hours, is

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In these six ways do ascetics and brahmins show
  their compassion towards a householder who ministers to them as the <b>Zenith</b>. Thus is
  the <b>Zenith</b> covered by him and made safe and secure.&quot; Thus spoke the Exalted
  One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mother and father are the East,<br>
    The Teachers are the South,<br>
    Wife and Children are the West,<br>
    The friends and associates are the North.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Servants and employees are the Nadir,<br>
    The ascetics and brahmins are the Zenith;<br>
    Who is fit to lead the household life,<br>
    These six quarters he should salute.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Who is wise and virtuous,<br>
    Gentle and keen-witted,<br>
    Humble and amenable,<br>
    Such a one to honour may attain.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Who is energetic and not indolent,<br>
    In misfortune unshaken,<br>
    Flawless in manner and intelligent,<br>
    Such a one to honour may attain.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Who is hospitable, and friendly,<br>
    Liberal and unselfish,<br>
    A guide, an instructor, a leader,<br>
    Such a one to honour may attain.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Generosity, sweet speech,<br>
    Helpfulness to others,<br>
    Impartiality to all,<br>
    As the case demands. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These four winning ways make the world go round,<br>
    As the linchpin in a moving car.<br>
    If these in the world exist not,<br>
    Neither mother nor father will receive,<br>
    Respect and honour from their children. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since these four winning ways<br>
    The wise appraise in every way,<br>
    To eminence they attain,<br>
    And praise they rightly gain. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Exalted One had spoken thus, Sigala, the young
  householder, said as follows: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<a name="magnif">Excellent</a>, Lord, excellent! It
  is as if, Lord, a man were to set upright that which was overturned, or were to reveal
  that which was hidden, or were to point out the way to one who had gone astray, or were to
  hold a lamp amidst the darkness, so that those who have eyes may see. Even so, has the
  doctrine been explained in various ways by the Exalted One. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I take refuge, Lord, in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and
  the Sangha. May the Exalted One receive me as a lay follower; as one who has taken refuge
  from this very day to life's end.&quot; </font></p>

  these good actions is offered to the departed after such ceremony. Moreover after every <i>punna-kamma</i>
  (good action), a Buddhist never fails to think of his parents and offer merit. Such is the
  loyalty and the gratitude shown to parents as advised by the Buddha.<!-- TXT_CUT_START --> [<a href="#9">Go back</a>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END --></font></p>
