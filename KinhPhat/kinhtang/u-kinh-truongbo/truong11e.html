  <hr width="25%" align="center">
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I </font>have heard that on one occasion
  the Blessed One was staying at Nalanda in Pavarika's mango grove. Then Kevatta the
  householder approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat to one
  side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: &quot;Venerable sir, this
  Nalanda is powerful, both prosperous and populous, filled with people who have faith in
  the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One were to direct a monk to display a
  miracle of psychic power from his superior human state so that Nalanda would to an even
  greater extent have faith in the Blessed One.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this was said, the Blessed One said to Kevatta the
  householder, &quot;Kevatta, I don't teach the monks in this way: 'Come, monks, display a
  miracle of psychic power to the lay people clad in white.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A second time... A third time, Kevatta the householder
  said to the Blessed One: &quot;I won't argue with the Blessed One, but I tell you:
  Venerable sir, this Nalanda is powerful, both prosperous and populous, filled with people
  who have faith in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One were to direct a
  monk to display a miracle of psychic power from his superior human state so that Nalanda
  would to an even greater extent have faith in the Blessed One.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A third time, the Blessed One said to Kevatta the
  householder, &quot;Kevatta, I don't teach the monks in this way: 'Come, monks, display a
  miracle of psychic power to the lay people clad in white.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Kevatta, there are these three miracles that I have
  declared, having directly known and realized them for myself. Which three? The miracle of
  psychic power, the miracle of telepathy, and the miracle of instruction. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Miracle of Psychic Power)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is the miracle of psychic power? There is
  the case where a monk wields manifold psychic powers. Having been one he becomes many;
  having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls,
  ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it
  were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged
  he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the
  sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as
  the Brahma worlds. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then someone who has faith and conviction in him
  sees him wielding manifold psychic powers... exercising influence with his body even as
  far as the Brahma worlds. He reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction,
  telling him, 'Isn't it awesome. Isn't it astounding, how great the power, how great the
  prowess of this contemplative. Just now I saw him wielding manifold psychic powers...
  exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the person without faith, without conviction, would
  say to the person with faith and with conviction: 'Sir, there is a charm called the
  Gandhari charm by which the monk wielded manifold psychic powers... exercising influence
  with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.' What do you think, Kevatta -- isn't that
  what the man without faith, without conviction, would say to the man with faith and with
  conviction?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, venerable sir, that's just what he would
  say.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Seeing this drawback to the miracle of psychic
  power, Kevatta, I feel horrified, humiliated, and disgusted with the miracle of psychic
  power. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Miracle of Telepathy)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is the miracle of telepathy? There is the
  case where a monk reads the minds, the mental events, the thoughts, the ponderings of
  other beings, other individuals, [saying,] 'Such is your thinking, here is where your
  thinking is, thus is your mind.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then someone who has faith and conviction in him
  sees him reading the minds... of other beings... He reports this to someone who has no
  faith and no conviction, telling him, 'Isn't it awesome. Isn't it astounding, how great
  the power, how great the prowess of this contemplative. Just now I saw him reading the
  minds... of other beings...' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then the person without faith, without conviction,
  would say to the person with faith and with conviction: 'Sir, there is a charm called the
  Manika charm by which the monk read the minds... of other beings...' What do you think,
  Kevatta -- isn't that what the man without faith, without conviction, would say to the man
  with faith and with conviction?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, venerable sir, that's just what he would
  say.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Seeing this drawback to the miracle of telepathy,
  Kevatta, I feel horrified, humiliated, and disgusted with the miracle of telepathy. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Miracle of Instruction)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is the miracle of instruction? There is the
  case where a monk gives instruction in this way: 'Direct your thought in this way, don't
  direct it in that. Attend to things in this way, don't attend to them in that. Let go of
  this, enter and remain in that.' This, Kevatta, is called the miracle of instruction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Furthermore, there is the case where a Tathagata
  appears in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened. He teaches the Dhamma admirable in
  its beginning, admirable in its middle, admirable in its end. He proclaims the holy life
  both in its particulars and in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A householder or householder's son, hearing the
  Dhamma, gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects: 'Household life is confining, a
  dusty path. The life gone forth is like the open air. It is not easy living at home to
  practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, like a polished shell. What if I
  were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the
  household life into homelessness?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth,
  large or small; leaves his circle of relatives, large or small; shaves off his hair and
  beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When he has thus gone forth, he lives restrained by
  the rules of the monastic code, seeing danger in the slightest faults. Consummate in his
  virtue, he guards the doors of his senses, is possessed of mindfulness and alertness, and
  is content. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Lesser Section on Virtue)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And how is a monk consummate in virtue? Abandoning
  the taking of life, he abstains from the taking of life. He dwells with his rod laid down,
  his knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living
  beings. This is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he
  abstains from taking what is not given. He takes only what is given, accepts only what is
  given, lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure. This, too, is
  part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Abandoning uncelibacy, he lives a celibate life,
  aloof, refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way. This, too, is part of
  his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false
  speech. He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the
  world. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive
  speech. What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from
  these people here. What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people
  apart from those people there. Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing
  those who are united, he loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things
  that create concord. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive
  speech. He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that go to
  the heart, that are polite, appealing and pleasing to people at large. This, too, is part
  of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle
  chatter. He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal,
  the Dhamma, and the Vinaya. He speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable,
  circumscribed, connected with the goal. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from damaging seed and plant life. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He eats only once a day, refraining from the evening
  meal and from food at the wrong time of day. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from dancing, singing, instrumental
  music, and from watching shows. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from wearing garlands and from
  beautifying himself with scents and cosmetics. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from high and luxurious beds and seats. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from accepting gold and money. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from accepting uncooked grain... raw
  meat... women and girls... male and female slaves... goats and sheep... fowl and pigs...
  elephants, cattle, steeds, and mares... fields and property. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from running messages... from buying and
  selling... from dealing with false scales, false metals, and false measures... from
  bribery, deception, and fraud. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He abstains from mutilating, executing, imprisoning,
  highway robbery, plunder, and violence. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Intermediate Section on Virtue)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whereas some priests and contemplatives, living off
  food given in faith, are addicted to damaging seed and plant life such as these -- plants
  propagated from roots, stems, joints, buddings, and seeds -- he abstains from damaging
  seed and plant life such as these. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whereas some priests and contemplatives, living off
  food given in faith, are addicted to consuming stored-up goods such as these -- stored-up
  food, stored-up drinks, stored-up clothing, stored-up vehicles, stored-up bedding,
  stored-up scents, and stored-up meat -- he abstains from consuming stored-up goods such as
  these. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whereas some priests and contemplatives, living off
  food given in faith, are addicted to watching shows such as these -- dancing, singing,
  instrumental music, plays, ballad recitations, hand-clapping, cymbals and drums, painted
  scenes, acrobatic and conjuring tricks, elephant fights, horse fights, buffalo fights,
  bull fights, goat fights, ram fights, cock fights, quail fights; fighting with staves,
  boxing, wrestling, war-games, roll calls, battle arrays, and regimental reviews -- he
  abstains from watching shows such as these. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whereas some priests and contemplatives, living off
  food given in faith, are addicted to heedless and idle games such as these -- eight-row
  chess, ten-row chess, chess in the air, hopscotch, spillikins, dice, stick games,
  hand-pictures, ball-games, blowing through toy pipes, playing with toy plows, turning
  somersaults, playing with toy windmills, toy measures, toy chariots, toy bows, guessing
  letters drawn in the air, guessing thoughts, mimicking deformities -- he abstains from
  heedless and idle games such as these. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whereas some priests and contemplatives, living off
  food given in faith, are addicted to high and luxurious furnishings such as these --
  over-sized couches, couches adorned with carved animals, long-haired coverlets,
  multi-colored patchwork coverlets, white woolen coverlets, woolen coverlets embroidered
  with flowers or animal figures, stuffed quilts, coverlets with fringe, silk coverlets
  embroidered with gems; large woolen carpets; elephant, horse, and chariot rugs,
  antelope-hide rugs, deer-hide rugs; couches with awnings, couches with red cushions for
  the head and feet -- he abstains from using high and luxurious furnishings such as these.
  This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whereas some priests and contemplatives, living off
  food given in faith, are addicted to scents, cosmetics, and means of beautification such
  as these -- rubbing powders into the body, massaging with oils, bathing in perfumed water,
  kneading the limbs, using mirrors, ointments, garlands, scents, creams, face-powders,
  mascara, bracelets, head-bands, decorated walking sticks, ornamented water-bottles,
  swords, fancy sunshades, decorated sandals, turbans, gems, yak-tail whisks, long-fringed
  white robes -- he abstains from using scents, cosmetics, and means of beautification such
  as these. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whereas some priests and contemplatives, living off
  food given in faith, are addicted to talking about lowly topics such as these -- talking
  about kings, robbers, ministers of state; armies, alarms, and battles; food and drink;
  clothing, furniture, garlands, and scents; relatives; vehicles; villages, towns, cities,
  the countryside; women and heroes; the gossip of the street and the well; tales of the
  dead; tales of diversity [philosophical discussions of the past and future], the creation
  of the world and of the sea, and talk of whether things exist or not -- he abstains from
  talking about lowly topics such as these. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whereas some priests and contemplatives, living off
  food given in faith, are addicted to debates such as these -- '<i>You</i> understand this
  doctrine and discipline? <i>I'm</i> the one who understands this doctrine and discipline.
  How could you understand this doctrine and discipline? You're practicing wrongly. I'm
  practicing rightly. I'm being consistent. You're not. What should be said first you said
  last. What should be said last you said first. What you took so long to think out has been
  refuted. Your doctrine has been overthrown. You're defeated. Go and try to salvage your
  doctrine; extricate yourself if you can!' -- he abstains from debates such as these. This,
  too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whereas some priests and contemplatives, living off
  food given in faith, are addicted to running messages and errands for people such as these
  -- kings, ministers of state, noble warriors, priests, householders, or youths [who say],
  'Go here, go there, take this there, fetch that here' -- he abstains from running messages
  and errands for people such as these. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whereas some priests and contemplatives, living off
  food given in faith, engage in scheming, persuading, hinting, belittling, and pursuing
  gain with gain, he abstains from forms of scheming and persuading [improper ways of trying
  to gain material support from donors] such as these. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Great Section on Virtue)</font></h4>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">he abstains from wrong livelihood, from lowly arts such as
  these. This, too, is part of his virtue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A monk thus consummate in virtue sees no danger
  anywhere from his restraint through virtue. Just as a head-anointed noble warrior king who
  has defeated his enemies sees no danger anywhere from his enemies, in the same way the
  monk thus consummate in virtue sees no danger anywhere from his restraint through virtue.
  Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue, he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of
  being blameless. This is how a monk is consummate in virtue. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Sense Restraint)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And how does a monk guard the doors of his senses?
  On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which -- if he
  were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye -- evil, unskillful qualities
  such as greed or distress might assail him. On hearing a sound with the ear... On smelling
  an odor with the nose... One tasting a flavor with the tongue... On touching a tactile
  sensation with the body... On cognizing an idea with the intellect, he does not grasp at
  any theme or details by which -- if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of
  the intellect -- evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him.
  Endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties, he is inwardly sensitive to
  the pleasure of being blameless. This is how a monk guards the doors of his senses. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Mindfulness and Alertness)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And how is a monk possessed of mindfulness and
  alertness? When going forward and returning, he acts with alertness. When looking toward
  and looking away... when bending and extending his limbs... when carrying his outer cloak,
  his upper robe, and his bowl... when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting... when
  urinating and defecating... when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up,
  talking, and remaining silent, he acts with alertness. This is how a monk is possessed of
  mindfulness and alertness. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Contentedness)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And how is a monk content? Just as a bird, wherever
  it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden; so too is he content with a set of robes
  to provide for his body and almsfood to provide for his hunger. Wherever he goes, he takes
  only his barest necessities along. This is how a monk is content. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Abandoning the Hindrances)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue, this
  noble restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness and alertness, and this
  noble contentment, he seeks out a secluded dwelling: a forest, the shade of a tree, a
  mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle grove, the open air, a heap
  of straw. After his meal, returning from his alms round, he sits down, crosses his legs,
  holds his body erect, and brings mindfulness to the fore. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he
  dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of covetousness.
  Abandoning ill will and anger, he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will, sympathetic
  with the welfare of all living beings. He cleanses his mind of ill will and anger.
  Abandoning sloth and torpor, he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and torpor,
  mindful, alert, percipient of light. He cleanses his mind of covetousness. Abandoning
  restlessness and anxiety, he dwells undisturbed, his mind inwardly stilled. He cleanses
  his mind of restlessness and anxiety. Abandoning uncertainty, he dwells having crossed
  over uncertainty, with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities. He cleanses
  his mind of uncertainty. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Suppose that a man, taking a loan, invests it in his
  business affairs. His business affairs succeed. He repays his old debts and there is extra
  left over for maintaining his wife. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, taking a
  loan, I invested it in my business affairs. Now my business affairs have succeeded. I have
  repaid my old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife.' Because of that
  he would experience joy and happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now suppose that a man falls sick -- in pain and
  seriously ill. He does not enjoy his meals, and there is no strength in his body. As time
  passes, he eventually recovers from that sickness. He enjoys his meals and there is
  strength in his body. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was sick... Now I am
  recovered from that sickness. I enjoy my meals and there is strength in my body.' Because
  of that he would experience joy and happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now suppose that a man is bound in prison. As time
  passes, he eventually is released from that bondage, safe and sound, with no loss of
  property. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was bound in prison. Now I am
  released from that bondage, safe and sound, with no loss of my property.' Because of that
  he would experience joy and happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now suppose that a man is a slave, subject to
  others, not subject to himself, unable to go where he likes. As time passes, he eventually
  is released from that slavery, subject to himself, not subject to others, freed, able to
  go where he likes. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was a slave... Now I am
  released from that slavery, subject to myself, not subject to others, freed, able to go
  where I like.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now suppose that a man, carrying money and goods, is
  traveling by a road through desolate country. As time passes, he eventually emerges from
  that desolate country, safe and sound, with no loss of property. The thought would occur
  to him, 'Before, carrying money and goods, I was traveling by a road through desolate
  country. Now I have emerged from that desolate country, safe and sound, with no loss of my
  property.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In the same way, when these five hindrances are not
  abandoned in himself, the monk regards it as a debt, a sickness, a prison, slavery, a road
  through desolate country. But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself, he
  regards it as unindebtedness, good health, release from prison, freedom, a place of
  security. Seeing that they have been abandoned within him, he becomes glad. Glad, he
  becomes enraptured. Enraptured, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he is
  sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Four Jhanas)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures, withdrawn
  from unskillful mental qualities, he enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture and
  pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation. He
  permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure
  born from withdrawal. Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath
  powder into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again and again with water,
  so that his ball of bath powder -- saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within and without
  -- would nevertheless not drip; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the
  rapture and pleasure born of withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by
  rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, is called the miracle of instruction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thought
  and evaluation, he enters and remains in the second jhana: rapture and pleasure born of
  composure, one-pointedness of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation --
  internal assurance. He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the
  rapture and pleasure born of composure. Just like a lake with spring-water welling up from
  within, having no inflow from the east, west, north, or south, and with the skies
  supplying abundant showers time and again, so that the cool fount of water welling up from
  within the lake would permeate and pervade, suffuse and fill it with cool waters, there
  being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters; even so, the monk permeates...
  this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure. There is nothing of his
  entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composure. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, is called the miracle of instruction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And furthermore, with the fading of rapture, he
  remains in equanimity, mindful and fully aware, and physically sensitive of pleasure. He
  enters and remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous and
  mindful, he has a pleasurable abiding.' He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this
  very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. Just as in a lotus pond, some of the
  lotuses, born and growing in the water, stay immersed in the water and flourish without
  standing up out of the water, so that they are permeated and pervaded, suffused and filled
  with cool water from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those lotuses would be
  unpervaded with cool water; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the
  pleasure divested of rapture. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure
  divested of rapture. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, is called the miracle of instruction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure and
  stress -- as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress -- he enters and
  remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither-pleasure nor
  stress. He sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. Just as if a man were
  sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his
  body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body
  with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure,
  bright awareness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, is called the miracle of instruction. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Insight Knowledge)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This
  body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother
  and father, nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing,
  dissolution, and dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up
  here.' Just as if there were a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water -- eight faceted,
  well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects, and going through the middle
  of it was a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread -- and a man with good eyesight,
  taking it in his hand, were to reflect on it thus: 'This is a beautiful beryl gem of the
  purest water, eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects.
  And this, going through the middle of it, is a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.'
  In the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished,
  free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk
  directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, is called the miracle of instruction. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Mind-made Body)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body
  he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts,
  not inferior in its faculties. Just as if a man were to draw a reed from its sheath. The
  thought would occur to him: 'This is the sheath, this is the reed. The sheath is one
  thing, the reed another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' Or as if a man
  were to draw a sword from its scabbard. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the
  sword, this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword
  has been drawn out from the scabbard.' Or as if a man were to pull a snake out from its
  slough. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake
  is one thing, the slough another, but the snake has been pulled out from the slough.' In
  the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free
  from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk
  directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another
  body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its
  faculties. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, is called the miracle of instruction. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Supranormal Powers)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers. He wields
  manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes
  one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as
  if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water
  without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like
  a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and
  powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. Just as a
  skilled potter or his assistant could craft from well-prepared clay whatever kind of
  pottery vessel he likes, or as a skilled ivory-carver or his assistant could craft from
  well-prepared ivory any kind of ivory-work he likes, or as a skilled goldsmith or his
  assistant could craft from well-prepared gold any kind of gold article he likes; in the
  same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from
  defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs
  and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers... He exercises influence with his body
  even as far as the Brahma worlds. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, is called the miracle of instruction. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Clairaudience)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears -- by
  means of the divine ear-element, purified and surpassing the human -- both kinds of
  sounds: divine and human, whether near or far. Just as if a man traveling along a highway
  were to hear the sounds of kettledrums, small drums, conchs, cymbals, and tom-toms. He
  would know, 'That is the sound of kettledrums, that is the sound of small drums, that is
  the sound of conchs, that is the sound of cymbals, and that is the sound of tom-toms.' In
  the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free
  from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk
  directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears -- by means of the divine
  ear-element, purified and surpassing the human -- both kinds of sounds: divine and human,

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, is called the miracle of instruction. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Mind Reading)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other
  beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it
  with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind
  without passion as a mind without passion. He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with
  aversion, and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion. He discerns a mind with
  delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion.
  He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind, and a scattered mind as a scattered
  mind. He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind, and an unenlarged mind as an
  unenlarged mind. He discerns an excelled mind [one that is not at the most excellent
  level] as an excelled mind, and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind. He discerns a
  concentrated mind as a concentrated mind, and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated
  mind. He discerns a released mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an
  unreleased mind. Just as if a young woman -- or man -- fond of ornaments, examining the
  reflection of her own face in a bright mirror or a bowl of clear water would know
  'blemished' if it were blemished, or 'unblemished' if it were not. In the same way -- with
  his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant,
  malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs and inclines it to
  knowledge of the awareness of other beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, is called the miracle of instruction. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Recollection of Past Lives)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past
  lives (lit: previous homes). He recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two
  births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one
  thousand, one hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic
  expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion, [recollecting], 'There I had
  such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my
  experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I
  re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an
  appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my
  life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past
  lives in their modes and details. Just as if a man were to go from his home village to
  another village, and then from that village to yet another village, and then from that
  village back to his home village. The thought would occur to him, 'I went from my home
  village to that village over there. There I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked
  in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I went to that village
  over there, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and
  remained silent in such a way. From that village I came back home.' In the same way --
  with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects,
  pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs and
  inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives. He recollects his manifold

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and
  re-appearance of beings. He sees -- by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing
  the human -- beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior
  and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their
  kamma: 'These beings -- who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who
  reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of
  wrong views -- with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane
  of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings -- who
  were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble
  ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views --
  with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in
  the heavenly world.' Thus -- by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human
  -- he sees beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and
  superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.
  Just as if there were a tall building in the central square [of a town], and a man with
  good eyesight standing on top of it were to see people entering a house, leaving it,
  walking along the street, and sitting in the central square. The thought would occur to
  him, 'These people are entering a house, leaving it, walking along the streets, and
  sitting in the central square.' In the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated,
  purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and
  attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and
  bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to
  imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the
  mental fermentations. He discerns, as it is actually present, that 'This is stress... This
  is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading
  to the cessation of stress... These are mental fermentations... This is the origination of
  fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the
  cessation of fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the
  fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance.
  With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the
  holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.' Just as if
  there were a pool of water in a mountain glen -- clear, limpid, and unsullied -- where a
  man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and
  also shoals of fish swimming about and resting, and it would occur to him, 'This pool of
  water is clear, limpid, and unsullied. Here are these shells, gravel, and pebbles, and

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, too, is called the miracle of instruction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;These are the three miracles that I declare,
  Kevatta, having directly known and realized them for myself. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Conversations with the Gods)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Once, Kevatta, this train of thought arose in the
  awareness of a certain monk in this very community of monks: 'Where do these four great
  elements -- the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind
  property -- cease without remainder?' Then he attained to such a state of concentration
  that the way leading to the gods appeared in his centered mind. So he approached the gods
  of the retinue of the Four Great Kings and, on arrival, asked them, 'Friends, where do
  these four great elements -- the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property,
  and the wind property -- cease without remainder?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When this was said, the gods of the retinue of the
  Four Great Kings said to the monk, 'We also don't know where the four great elements...
  cease without remainder. But there are the Four Great Kings who are higher and more
  sublime than us. They should know where the four great elements... cease without
  remainder.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So the monk approached the Four Great Kings and, on
  arrival, asked them, 'Friends, where do these four great elements... cease without
  remainder?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When this was said, the Four Great Kings said to the
  monk, 'We also don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. But
  there are the gods of the Thirty-three who are higher and more sublime than us. They
  should know...' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So the monk approached the gods of the Thirty-three
  and, on arrival, asked them, 'Friends, where do these four great elements... cease without
  remainder?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When this was said, the gods of the Thirty-three
  said to the monk, 'We also don't know where the four great elements... cease without
  remainder. But there is Sakka, the ruler of the gods, who is higher and more sublime than
  us. He should know... ' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So the monk approached Sakka, the ruler of the gods,
  and, on arrival, asked him, 'Friend, where do these four great elements... cease without
  remainder?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When this was said, Sakka, the ruler of the gods,
  said to the monk, 'I also don't know where the four great elements... cease without
  remainder. But there are the Yama gods who are higher and more sublime than I. They should
  know...'... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The Yama gods said, 'We also don't know... But there
  is the god named Suyama... He should know...'... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Suyama said, 'I also don't know... But there is the
  god named Santusita... He should know...'... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Santusita said, 'I also don't know... But there are
  the Nimmanarati gods... They should know...'... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The Nimmanarati gods said, 'We also don't know...
  But there is the god named Sunimmita... He should know...'... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sunimmita said, 'I also don't know... But there are
  the Paranimmitavasavatti gods... They should know...'... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The Paranimmitavasavatti gods said, 'We also don't
  know... But there is the god named Paranimmita Vasavatti... He should know...'... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So the monk approached the god Vasavatti and, on
  arrival, asked him, 'Friend, where do these four great elements... cease without
  remainder?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When this was said, the god Vasavatti said to the
  monk, 'I also don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. But
  there are the gods of the retinue of Brahma who are higher and more sublime than I. They
  should know where the four great elements... cease without remainder'... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then the monk attained to such a state of
  concentration that the way leading to the gods of the retinue of Brahma appeared in his
  centered mind. So he approached the gods of the retinue of Brahma and, on arrival, asked
  them, 'Friends, where do these four great elements -- the earth property, the liquid
  property, the fire property, and the wind property -- cease without remainder?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When this was said, the gods of the retinue of
  Brahma said to the monk, 'We also don't know where the four great elements... cease
  without remainder. But there is Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered,
  the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and
  Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. He is higher and more sublime than we.
  He should know where the four great elements... cease without remainder.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'But where, friends, is the Great Brahma now?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'Monk, we also don't know where Brahma is or in what
  way Brahma is. But when signs appear, light shines forth, and a radiance appears, Brahma
  will appear. For these are the portents of Brahma's appearance: light shines forth and a
  radiance appears.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then it was not long before Brahma appeared. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So the monk approached the Great Brahma and, on
  arrival, said, 'Friend, where do these four great elements -- the earth property, the
  liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property -- cease without remainder?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When this was said, the Great Brahma said to the
  monk, 'I, monk, am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the
  All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and
  Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A second time, the monk said to the Great Brahma, 'Friend,
  I didn't ask you if you were Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the
  All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and
  Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. I asked you where these four great
  elements -- the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind
  property -- cease without remainder.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A second time, the Great Brahma said to the monk,
  'I, monk, am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing,
  All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father
  of All That Have Been and Shall Be.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A third time, the monk said to the Great Brahma,
  'Friend, I didn't ask you if you were Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the
  Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief,
  Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. I asked you where these
  four great elements -- the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the
  wind property -- cease without remainder.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then the Great Brahma, taking the monk by the arm
  and leading him off to one side, said to him, 'These gods of the retinue of Brahma
  believe, &quot;There is nothing that the Great Brahma does not know. There is nothing that
  the Great Brahma does not see. There is nothing of which the Great Brahma is unaware.
  There is nothing that the Great Brahma has not realized.&quot; That is why I did not say
  in their presence that I, too, don't know where the four great elements... cease without
  remainder. So you have acted wrongly, acted incorrectly, in bypassing the Blessed One in
  search of an answer to this question elsewhere. Go right back to the Blessed One and, on
  arrival, ask him this question. However he answers it, you should take it to heart.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then -- just as a strong man might extend his flexed
  arm or flex his extended arm -- the monk disappeared from the Brahma world and immediately
  appeared in front of me. Having bowed down to me, he sat to one side. As he was sitting
  there he said to me, 'Venerable sir, where do these four great elements -- the earth
  property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property -- cease without
  remainder?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When this was said, I said to him, 'Once, monk, some
  sea-faring merchants took a shore-sighting bird and set sail in their ship. When they
  could not see the shore, they released the shore-sighting bird. It flew to the east,
  south, west, north, straight up, and to all the intermediate points of the compass. If it
  saw the shore in any direction, it flew there. If it did not see the shore in any
  direction, it returned right back to the ship. In the same way, monk, having gone as far
  as the Brahma world in search of an answer to your question, you have come right back to
  my presence. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'Your question should not be phrased in this way:
  Where do these four great elements -- the earth property, the liquid property, the fire
  property, and the wind property -- cease without remainder? Instead, it should be phrased
  like this: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Where do water, earth, fire, and wind<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have no footing?<br>
    Where are long and short,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coarse and fine,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fair and foul,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name and form<br>
    brought to an end? </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'And the answer to that is: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness without feature,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without end,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; luminous all around:<br>
    Here water, earth, fire, and wind<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have no footing.<br>
    Here long and short<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coarse and fine<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fair and foul<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name and form<br>
    are all brought to an end.<br>
    With the cessation of [the activity of] consciousness<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each is here brought to an end.'&quot; </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Kevatta the
  householder delighted in the Blessed One's words. </font></p>
