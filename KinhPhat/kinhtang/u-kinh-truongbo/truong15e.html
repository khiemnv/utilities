  The Great Causes Discourse</font></h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Translator's Introduction</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">This is one of the most profound discourses in the
    Pali Canon. It gives an extended treatment of the teachings of dependent co-arising
    (paticca samuppada) and not-self (anatta) in an outlined context of how these teachings
    function in practice. </font></em></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">The first part of the discourse takes the factors of
    dependent co-arising in sequence from effect to cause, tracing them down to the mutual
    dependency of name-and-form (mental and physical activity) on the one hand, and
    consciousness on the other. In connection with this point, it is worth noting that the
    word &quot;great&quot; in the title of the discourse may have a double meaning: modifying
    the word &quot;discourse&quot; -- it's a long discourse -- and modifying
    &quot;causes,&quot; referring to the fact that name-and-form and consciousness as causal
    factors can account for everything describable in the cosmos. </font></em></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">After tracing the basic sequence of factors in the
    causal pattern, the discourse then reviews their inter-relationships, showing how they can
    explain stress and suffering both on the individual and on the social level. </font></em></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">The second part of the discourse, taking up the
    teaching of not-self, shows how dependent co-arising gives focus to this teaching in
    practice. It begins with a section on Delineations of a Self, classifying the various ways
    in which a sense of &quot;self&quot; might be defined in terms of form. The scheme of
    analysis introduced in this section -- classifying views of the self according to the
    variables of form and formless; finite and infinite; already existing, naturally
    developing in the future, and alterable through human effort -- covers all the theories of
    the self proposed in the classical Upanisads, as well as all theories of self or soul
    proposed in more recent times. The inclusion of an infinite self in this list gives the
    lie to the belief that the Buddha's teachings on not-self were denying nothing more than a
    sense of &quot;separate&quot; or &quot;limited&quot; self. The discourse points out that
    even a limitless, infinite, all-embracing sense of self is based on an underlying tendency
    in the mind that has to be abandoned. </font></em></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">The following section, on Non-delineations of a Self,
    shows that it is possible for the mind to function without reading a &quot;self&quot; into
    experience. The remaining sections focus on ways in which this can be done by treating the
    sense of self as it relates to different aspects of name-and-form. The first of these
    sections -- Assumptions of a Self -- focuses on the sense of self as it relates to
    feeling, one of the &quot;name&quot; factors in name-and-form. The next section -- Seven
    Stations of Consciousness -- focuses on form, formlessness, and perception, which is
    another one of the &quot;name&quot; factors that allows a place for consciousness to land
    and grow on the &quot;macro&quot; level in the cycle of death and rebirth. The last
    section -- Eight Emancipations -- focuses on form, formlessness, and perception on the
    &quot;micro&quot; level in the practice of meditative absorption (jhana). </font></em></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">In each of these cases, once the sense of attachment
    and identification with name-and-form can be broken, the mutual dependency between
    consciousness and name-and-form is broken as well. This brings about total freedom from
    the limits of &quot;the extent to which there are means of designation, expression, and
    delineation... the extent to which the sphere of discernment extends, the extent to which
    the cycle revolves for the manifesting (discernibility) of this world -- i.e.,
    name-and-form together with consciousness.&quot; This is the release at which the Buddha's
    teachings are aimed. </font></em></p>

  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Dependent Co-arising)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was
  living among the Kurus. Now, the Kurus have a town named Kammasadhamma. There Ven. Ananda
  approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to
  one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: &quot;It's amazing, lord,
  it's astounding, how deep this dependent co-arising is, and how deep its appearance, and
  yet to me it seems as clear as clear can be.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">[The Buddha:] &quot;Don't say that, Ananda. Don't say
  that. Deep is this dependent co-arising, and deep its appearance. It's because of not
  understanding and not penetrating this Dhamma that this generation is like a tangled
  skein, a knotted ball of string, like matted rushes and reeds, and does not go beyond
  transmigration, beyond the planes of deprivation, woe, and bad destinations. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite
  condition for aging and death?' one should answer, 'There is.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition do
  aging and death come?' one should say, 'Aging and death come from birth as their requisite
  condition.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite
  condition for birth?' one should answer, 'There is.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does
  birth come?' one should say, 'Birth comes from becoming as its requisite condition.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite
  condition for becoming?' one should answer, 'There is.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does
  becoming come?' one should say, 'Becoming comes from clinging as its requisite condition.'
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite
  condition for clinging?' one should answer, 'There is.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does
  clinging come?' one should say, 'Clinging comes from craving as its requisite condition.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite
  condition for craving?' one should answer, 'There is.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does
  craving come?' one should say, 'Craving comes from feeling as its requisite condition.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite
  condition for feeling?' one should answer, 'There is.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does
  feeling come?' one should say, 'Feeling comes from contact as its requisite condition.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite
  condition for contact?' one should answer, 'There is.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does
  contact come?' one should say, 'Contact comes from name-and-form as its requisite
  condition.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite
  condition for name-and-form?' one should answer, 'There is.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does
  name-and-form come?' one should say, 'Name-and-form comes from consciousness as its
  requisite condition.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite
  condition for consciousness?' one should answer, 'There is.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does
  consciousness come?' one should say, 'Consciousness comes from name-and-form as its
  requisite condition.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus, Ananda, from name-and-form as a requisite
  condition comes consciousness. From consciousness as a requisite condition comes
  name-and-form. From name-and-form as a requisite condition comes contact. From contact as
  a requisite condition comes feeling. From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.
  From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging. From clinging as a requisite
  condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth
  as a requisite condition, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair
  come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Aging and Death)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'From birth as a requisite condition come aging and
  death.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from birth as a
  requisite condition come aging and death. If there were no birth at all, in any way, of
  anything anywhere -- i.e., of devas in the state of devas, of celestials in the state of
  celestials, of spirits in the state of spirits, of demons in the state of demons, of human
  beings in the human state, of quadripeds in the state of quadripeds, of birds in the state
  of birds, of snakes in the state of snakes, or of any being in its own state -- in the
  utter absence of birth, from the cessation of birth, would aging and death be
  discerned?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an
  origination, this is a requisite condition for aging and death, i.e., birth.</font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Birth)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'From becoming as a requisite condition comes
  birth.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from becoming as a
  requisite condition comes birth. If there were no becoming at all, in any way, of anything
  anywhere -- i.e., sensual becoming, form becoming, or formless becoming -- in the utter
  absence of becoming, from the cessation of becoming, would birth be discerned?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an
  origination, this is a requisite condition for birth, i.e., becoming. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Becoming)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'From clinging as a requisite condition comes
  becoming.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from clinging as a
  requisite condition comes becoming. If there were no clinging at all, in any way, of
  anything anywhere -- i.e., clinging to sensuality, clinging to precepts and practices,
  clinging to views, or clinging to doctrines of the self -- in the utter absence of
  clinging, from the cessation of clinging, would becoming be discerned?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an
  origination, this is a requisite condition for becoming, i.e., clinging. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Clinging)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'From craving as a requisite condition comes
  clinging.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from craving as a
  requisite condition comes clinging. If there were no craving at all, in any way, of
  anything anywhere -- i.e., craving for sensuality, craving for becoming, craving for no
  becoming -- in the utter absence of craving, from the cessation of craving, would clinging
  be discerned?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an
  origination, this is a requisite condition for clinging, i.e., craving. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Craving)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'From feeling as a requisite condition comes
  craving.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from feeling as a
  requisite condition comes craving. If there were no feeling at all, in any way, of
  anything anywhere -- i.e., feeling born of contact at the eye, feeling born of contact at
  the ear, feeling born of contact at the nose, feeling born of contact at the tongue,
  feeling born of contact at the body, or feeling born of contact at the intellect -- in the
  utter absence of feeling, from the cessation of feeling, would craving be discerned?&quot;
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an
  origination, this is a requisite condition for craving, i.e., feeling. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Dependent on Craving)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now, craving is dependent on feeling,<br>
  seeking is dependent on craving,<br>
  acquisition is dependent on seeking,<br>
  ascertainment is dependent on acquisition,<br>
  desire and passion is dependent on ascertainment,<br>
  attachment is dependent on desire and passion,<br>
  possessiveness is dependent on attachment,<br>
  stinginess is dependent on attachment,<br>
  defensiveness is dependent on stinginess,<br>
  and because of defensiveness, dependent on defensiveness, various evil, unskillful
  phenomena come into play: the taking up of sticks and knives; conflicts, quarrels, and
  disputes; accusations, divisive speech, and lies. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And this is the way to understand how it is that
  because of defensiveness various evil, unskillful phenomena come into play: the taking up
  of sticks and knives; conflicts, quarrels, and disputes; accusations, divisive speech, and
  lies. If there were no defensiveness at all, in any way, of anything anywhere, in the
  utter absence of defensiveness, from the cessation of defensiveness, would various evil,
  unskillful phenomena -- the taking up of sticks and knives; conflicts, quarrels, and
  disputes; accusations, divisive speech, and lies -- come into play?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an
  origination, this is a requisite condition for the coming-into-play of various evil,
  unskillful phenomena -- the taking up of sticks and knives; conflicts, quarrels, and
  disputes; accusations, divisive speech, and lies -- i.e., defensiveness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'Defensiveness is dependent on stinginess.' Thus it
  has been said. And this is the way to understand how defensiveness is dependent on
  stinginess. If there were no stinginess at all, in any way, of anything anywhere, in the
  utter absence of stinginess, from the cessation of stinginess, would defensiveness be
  discerned?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an
  origination, this is a requisite condition for defensiveness, i.e., stinginess. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(Similarly back through the chain of conditions:
  stinginess, attachment, possessiveness, desire and passion, ascertainment, acquisition,
  and seeking.) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'Seeking is dependent on craving.' Thus it has been
  said. And this is the way to understand how seeing is dependent on craving. If there were
  no craving at all, in any way, of anything anywhere -- i.e., craving for sensuality,
  craving for becoming, craving for no becoming -- in the utter absence of craving, from the
  cessation of craving, would seeking be discerned?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an
  origination, this is a requisite condition for seeking, i.e., craving. Thus, Ananda, these
  two phenomena [the chain of conditions leading from craving to birth, aging, and death,
  and the chain of conditions leading from craving to quarrels, etc.], as a duality, flow
  back into one place at feeling. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Feeling)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'From contact as a requisite condition comes
  feeling.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from contact as a
  requisite condition comes feeling. If there were no contact at all, in any way, of
  anything anywhere -- i.e., contact at the eye, contact at the ear, contact at the nose,
  contact at the tongue, contact at the body, or contact at the intellect -- in the utter
  absence of contact, from the cessation of contact, would feeling be discerned?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an
  origination, this is a requisite condition for feeling, i.e., contact. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Contact)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'From name-and-form as a requisite condition comes
  contact.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how, from name-and-form
  as a requisite condition comes contact. If the qualities, traits, themes, and indicators
  by which there is a description of name-group (mental activity) were all absent, would
  designation-contact with regard to the form-group (the physical body) be discerned?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If the permutations, signs, themes, and indicators
  by which there is a description of form-group were all absent, would resistance-contact
  with regard to the name-group be discerned?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If the permutations, signs, themes, and indicators
  by which there is a description of name-group and form-group were all absent, would
  designation-contact or resistance-contact be discerned?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an
  origination, this is a requisite condition for contact, i.e., name-and-form. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Name-and-form)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'From consciousness as a requisite condition comes
  name-and-form.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from
  consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form. If consciousness were not to
  descend into the mother's womb, would name-and-form take shape in the womb?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If, after descending into the womb, consciousness
  were to depart, would name-and-form be produced for this world?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If the consciousness of the young boy or girl were
  to be cut off, would name-and-form ripen, grow, and reach maturity?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an
  origination, this is a requisite condition for name-and-form, i.e., consciousness.&quot; </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Consciousness)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'From name-and-form as a requisite condition comes
  consciousness.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from
  name-and-form as a requisite condition comes consciousness. If consciousness were not to
  gain a foothold in name-and-form, would a coming-into-play of the origination of birth,
  aging, death, and stress in the future be discerned? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an
  origination, this is a requisite condition for consciousness, i.e., name-and-form. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This is the extent to which there is birth, aging,
  death, passing away, and re-arising. This is the extent to which there are means of
  designation, expression, and delineation. This is the extent to which the sphere of
  discernment extends, the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting
  (discernibility) of this world -- i.e., name-and-form together with consciousness. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Delineations of a Self)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;To what extent, Ananda, does one delineate when
  delineating a self? Either delineating a self possessed of form and finite, one delineates
  that 'My self is possessed of form and finite.' Or, delineating a self possessed of form
  and infinite, one delineates that 'My self is possessed of form and infinite.' Or,
  delineating a self formless and finite, one delineates that 'My self is formless and
  finite.' Or, delineating a self formless and infinite, one delineates that 'My self is

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now, the one who, when delineating a self,

  of form and finite [in the future/after death], or he believes that 'Although it is not
  yet that way, I will convert it into being that way.' This being the case, it is proper to
  say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and finite lies latent [within that
  person]. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;To what extent, Ananda, does one assume when
  assuming a self? Assuming feeling to be the self, one assumes that 'Feeling is my self'
  [or] 'Feeling is not my self: My self is oblivious [to feeling]' [or] 'Neither is feeling
  my self, nor is my self oblivious to feeling, but rather my self feels, in that my self is
  subject to feeling.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now, one who says, 'Feeling is my self,' should be
  addressed as follows: 'There are these three feelings, my friend -- feelings of pleasure,
  feelings of pain, and feelings of neither pleasure nor pain. Which of these three feelings
  do you assume to be the self?' At a moment when a feeling of pleasure is sensed, no
  feeling of pain or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed. Only a feeling of pleasure is
  sensed at that moment. At a moment when a feeling of pain is sensed, no feeling of
  pleasure or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed. Only a feeling of pain is sensed at
  that moment. At a moment when a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed, no feeling
  of pleasure or of pain is sensed. Only a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed at
  that moment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now, a feeling of pleasure is inconstant,
  fabricated, dependent on conditions, subject to passing away, dissolution, fading, and
  cessation. A feeling of pain is inconstant, fabricated, dependent on conditions, subject
  to passing away, dissolution, fading, and cessation. A feeling of neither pleasure nor
  pain is inconstant, fabricated, dependent on conditions, subject to passing away,
  dissolution, fading, and cessation. Having sensed a feeling of pleasure as 'my self,' then
  with the cessation of one's very own feeling of pleasure, 'my self' has perished. Having
  sensed a feeling of pain as 'my self,' then with the cessation of one's very own feeling
  of pain, 'my self' has perished. Having sensed a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain as
  'my self,' then with the cessation of one's very own feeling of neither pleasure nor pain,
  'my self' has perished. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus he assumes, assuming in the immediate present a
  self inconstant, entangled in pleasure and pain, subject to arising and passing away, he
  who says, 'Feeling is my self.' Thus in this manner, Ananda, one does not see fit to
  assume feeling to be the self. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;As for the person who says, 'Feeling is not the
  self: My self is oblivious [to feeling],' he should be addressed as follows: 'My friend,
  where nothing whatsoever is sensed (experienced) at all, would there be the thought,
  &quot;I am&quot;?'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus in this manner, Ananda, one does not see fit to
  assume that 'Feeling is not my self: My self is oblivious [to feeling].' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;As for the person who says, 'Neither is feeling my
  self, nor is my self oblivious [to feeling], but rather my self feels, in that my self is
  subject to feeling,' he should be addressed as follows: 'My friend, should feelings
  altogether and every way stop without remainder, then with feeling completely not
  existing, owing to the cessation of feeling, would there be the thought, &quot;I
  am&quot;?'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus in this manner, Ananda, one does not see fit to
  assume that 'Neither is feeling my self, nor is my self oblivious [to feeling], but rather
  my self feels, in that my self is subject to feeling.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now, Ananda, in as far as a monk does not assume
  feeling to be the self, nor the self as oblivious, nor that 'My self feels, in that my
  self is subject to feeling,' then, not assuming in this way, he is not sustained by
  anything (does not cling to anything) in the world. Unsustained, he is not agitated.
  Unagitated, he is totally unbound right within. He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy
  life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If anyone were to say with regard to a monk whose
  mind is thus released that 'The Tathagata exists after death,' is his view, that would be
  mistaken; that 'The Tathagata does not exist after death'...that 'The Tathagata both
  exists and does not exist after death'...that 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not
  exist after death' is his view, that would be mistaken. Why? Having directly known the
  extent of designation and the extent of the objects of designation, the extent of
  expression and the extent of the objects of expression, the extent of description and the
  extent of the objects of description, the extent of discernment and the extent of the
  objects of discernment, the extent to which the cycle revolves: Having directly known
  that, the monk is released. [To say that,] <i>'The monk released, having directly known
  that, does not see, does not know</i> is his opinion,' that would be mistaken. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Seven Stations of Consciousness)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ananda, there are these seven stations of
  consciousness and two spheres. Which seven? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There are beings with diversity of body and
  diversity of perception, such as human beings, some devas, and some beings in the lower
  realms. This is the first station of consciousness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There are beings with diversity of body and
  singularity of perception, such as the devas of the Brahma hosts generated by the first
  [jhana]. This is the second station of consciousness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There are beings with singularity of body and
  diversity of perception, such as the Radiant Devas. This is the third station of
  consciousness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There are beings with singularity of body and
  singularity of perception, such as the Beautifully Lustrous Devas. This is the fourth
  station of consciousness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There are beings who,with the complete transcending
  of perceptions of [physical] form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance,
  and not heeding perceptions of diversity, thinking, 'Infinite space,' arrive at the sphere
  of the infinitude of space. This is the fifth station of consciousness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There are beings who, with the complete transcending
  of the sphere of the infinitude of space, thinking, 'Infinite consciousness,' arrive at
  the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness. This is the sixth station of consciousness.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There are beings who, with the complete transcending
  of the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness, thinking, 'There is nothing,' arrive at
  the sphere of nothingness. This is the seventh station of consciousness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The sphere of non-percipient beings and, second, the
  sphere of neither perception nor non-perception. [These are the two spheres.] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now, as for the first station of consciousness --
  beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception, such as human beings, some
  devas, and some beings in the lower realms: If one discerns that [station of
  consciousness], discerns its origination, discerns its passing away, discerns its allure,
  discerns its drawbacks, discerns the escape from it, would it be proper, by means of that
  [discernment] to take delight there?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, lord.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(Similarly with each of the remaining stations of
  consciousness and two spheres.) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ananda, when knowing -- as they actually are -- the
  origination, passing away, allure, drawbacks of -- and escape from -- these seven stations
  of consciousness and two spheres, a monk is release through lack of clinging, he is said
  to be a monk released through discernment. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Eight Emancipations)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ananda, there are these eight emancipations. Which
  eight? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Possessed of form, one sees forms. This is the first
  emancipation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Not percipient of form internally, one sees forms
  externally. This is the second emancipation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;One is intent only on the beautiful. This is the
  third emancipation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With the complete transcending of perceptions of
  [physical] form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding
  perceptions of diversity, thinking, 'Infinite space,' one enters and remains in the sphere
  of the infinitude of space. This is the fourth emancipation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With the complete transcending of the sphere of the
  infinitude of space, thinking, 'Infinite consciousness,' one enters and remains in the
  sphere of the infinitude of consciousness. This is the fifth emancipation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With the complete transcending of the sphere of the
  infinitude of consciousness, thinking, 'There is nothing,' one enters and remains in the
  sphere of nothingness. This is the sixth emancipation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With the complete transcending of the sphere of
  nothingness, one enters and remains in the sphere of neither perception nor
  non-perception. This is the seventh emancipation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With the complete transcending of the sphere of
  neither perception nor non-perception, one enters and remains in the cessation of
  perception and feeling. This is the eighth emancipation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now, when a monk attains these eight emancipations
  in forward order, in reverse order, in forward and reverse order, when he attains them and
  emerges from them wherever he wants, however he wants, and for as long as he wants, when
  through the ending of the mental fermentations he enters and remains in the
  fermentation-free release of awareness and release of discernment, having directly known
  it and realized it in the here and now, he is said to be a monk released in both ways. And
  as for another release in both ways, higher or more sublime than this, there is
  none.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Ananda
  delighted in the Blessed One's words. </font></p>
