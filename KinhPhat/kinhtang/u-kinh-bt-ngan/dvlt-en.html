  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"># 1. Thus it was heard by me. At one time the Bhagavat^1 dwelt in Rajagriha, on the
  mountain Gridhrakuta, with a large assembly of Bhikshus, with thirty-two thousands of
  Bhikshus, all holy (arhat), free from frailties and cares, who had performed their
  religious duties, whose thoughts had been thoroughly freed through perfect knowledge, with
  inquiring thoughts, who had broken the fetters of existence, who had obtained their
  desires, who had conquered, who had achieved the highest self restraint, whose thoughts
  and whose knowledge were unfettered, Mahanagas (great heroes), possessed of the six kinds
  of knowledge, self-controlled, meditating on the eight kinds of salvation, possessed of
  the powers, wise in wisdom, elders, great disciples, that is, 1. Ajnatakaundinya, 2.
  Asvajit, 3. Vashpa, 4. Mahanaman, 5. Bhadrajit, 6. Yasodeva, 7. Vimala, 8. Subahu, 9.
  Purna Maitrayaniputra^2, 10. Uruvilva-kasyapa, 11. Nadi-kasyapa, 12. Gaya-kasyapa, 13.
  Kumara-kasyapa, 14. Maha-kasyapa, 15. Shariputra^3, 16. Mahamaudgalyayana, 17.
  Mahakaushthilya, 18. Mahakaphila, 19. Mahakunda, 20. Aniruddha^4, 21. Nandika, 22.
  Kampila^5, 23. Subhuti, 24. Revata, 25. Khadiravanika^6, 26. Vakula, 27. Svagata, 28.
  Amogharaja, 29. Parayanika, 30. Patka, 31. Kullapatka, 32. Nanda, 33. Rahula, and 34. the
  blessed Ananda,--with these and with other elders, and great disciples, who were wise in
  wisdom, with the exception of one person who had still to be advanced on the path of the
  disciples, that is, the blessed Ananda;--and with many noble-minded Bodhisattvas, led by
  Maitreya. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#2. Then the blessed Ananda, having risen from his seat, having put his cloak on one
  shoulder, and knelt on the earth with his right knee, making obeisance with folded hands
  in the direction of the Bhagavat, spoke thus to the Bhagavat: 'Thy organs of sense, O
  Bhagavat, are serene, the colour of thy skin is clear, the colour of thy face bright and
  yellowish. As an autumn cloud is pale, clear, bright and yellowish, thus the organs of
  sense of the Bhagavat are serene, the colour of his face is clear, the colour of his skin
  bright and yellowish. And as, O Bhagavat, a piece of gold coming from the Jambu river,
  having been thrown into a furnace by a clever smith or by his apprentice, and well
  fashioned, when thrown on a pale cloth, looks extremely clear, bright and yellowish, thus
  the organs of sense of the Bhagavat are serene, the colour of his face is clear, and the
  colour of his skin bright and yellowish. Moreover, I do not know, O Bhagavat, that I have
  ever seen the organs of sense of the Tathagata so serene, the colour of his face so clear
  and the colour of his skin so bright and yellowish before now. This thought occurs to me,
  O Bhagavat: probably, the Tathagata dwells to-day in the state of a Buddha, probably the
  Tathagata dwells to-day in the state of a Jina, in the state of omniscience, in the state
  of a Mahanaga; and he contemplates the holy and fully enlightened Tathagatas of the past,
  future, and present.' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After these words, the Bhagavat thus spoke to the blessed Ananda: Well said! well said!
  Ananda. Did the gods suggest this matter to you? or the blessed Buddhas ? Or do you know
  this through the philosophical knowledge which you possess?' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After these words the blessed Ananda spoke thus to the Bhagavat: 'The gods, O Bhagavat,
  do not suggest this matter to me, nor the blessed Buddhas, but this thought occurs to me
  by my own philosophy alone, that is, that probably the Tathagata dwells to-day in the
  state of a Buddha, probably the Tathagata dwells to-day in the state of a Jina, in the
  state of omniscience, [in the state of a Mahanaga]^7; or he contemplates [the venerable
  Buddhas] of the past, future, and present.' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After these words the Bhagavat spoke thus to the blessed Ananda: 'Well said! well said!
  Ananda; excellent indeed is your question^8, good your philosophy, and beautiful your
  understanding! You, O Ananda, have arrived for the benefit and happiness of many people,
  out of compassion for the world, for the sake of the great body of men, for the benefit
  and happiness of gods and men, as you think it right to ask the Tathagata this matter^9:
  Thus, indeed, Ananda, might pile up^10 intellectual knowledge under immeasurable and
  innumerable blessed, holy, and fully enlightened Tathagatas, and yet the knowledge of the
  Tathagata would not be exceeded thereby. And why? Because, O Ananda, one who possesses the
  knowledge of a Tathagata possesses an intellectual knowledge of causes that cannot be
  exceeded^11. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'If ^12 the Tathagata wished O Ananda, he could live for a whole kalpa (age) on one
  alms-gift, or for a hundred kalpas, or for a thousand kalpas, or for a hundred thousand
  kalpas, to a hundred thousand nayutas of kotis of kalpas^13, nay, he could live beyond,
  and yet the organs of nature of the Tathagata would not perish, the colour of his face
  would not be altered, nor would the colour of his skin be injured. And why? Because, O
  Ananda, the Tathagata has so fully obtained the Paramitas^14 which arise from Samadhi^15.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'The appearance of fully enlightened Buddhas is very difficult to be obtained in this
  world, O Ananda. As the appearance of Audumbara-flowers is very difficult to be obtained
  in this world; thus, O Ananda, the appearance of Tathagatas who desire welfare, wish for
  what is beneficial, are compassionate, and have arrived at the highest compassion, is very
  difficult to be obtained. But, O Ananda, it is (owing to) the grace of the Tathagata
  himself that you think that the Tathagata should be asked this question, so that there may
  arise in this world beings who can be teachers of all the world, for the sake of
  noble-minded Bodhisattvas. Therefore, O Ananda, listen, and take it well and rightly to
  heart! I shall tell you.' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">' Yes, O Bhagavat,' so did the blessed Ananda answer the Bhagavat.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"># 3. The Bhagavat then spoke to Ananda: 'At the time, O Ananda, which was long ago in
  the past, in an innumerable and more than innumerable, enormous, immeasurable, and
  incomprehensible kalpa before now,--at that time, and at that moment, there arose in the
  world a holy and fully enlightened Tathagata called 1. Dipankara. Following after
  Dipankara, O Ananda, there was a Tathagata 2. Pratapavat, and after him, 3. Prabhakara, 4.

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'After Simhamati, a holy and fully enlightened Tathagata arose in the world,
  Lokesvararaja by name, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a Sugata, knowing the world,
  without a superior, charioteer of men whose passions have to be tamed, teacher of gods and
  men, a Buddha, a Bhagavat. And again during the time of the preaching of this holy and
  fully enlightened Tathagata Lokesvararaja, O Ananda, there was a Bhikshu, Dharmakara by
  name, richly endowed with memory, with understanding, prudence, and wisdom,--richly
  endowed with vigour, and of noble character. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"># 4. 'Then, O Ananda, that Bhikshu Dharmakara, having risen from his seat, having put
  his cloak on one shoulder, and knelt on the earth with his right knee, stretching forth
  his folded hands to where the Bhagavat Tathagata Lokesvararaja was, and, after worshipping
  the Bhagavat, he, at that very time, praised him in his presence with these Gathas:
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;O thou of immeasurable light, whose knowledge is endless and incomparable; not
  any other light can shine here (where thou art)! The rays of the moon of Siva and of the
  jewel of the sun, were not bright here in the whole world, (1) </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;The form also is infinite in the best of beings^16; thus also the voice of Buddha
  is of infinite sound; his virtue likewise, with meditation, knowledge^17, strength; like
  unto thee there is no one in this world. (2) </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;The Law (dharma) is deep, wide, and subtle; the best of Buddhas is
  incomprehensible, like the ocean; therefore there is no further exaltation of the teacher;
  having left all faults, he is gone to the other shore^18. (3) </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Then the best of Buddhas^19, of endless light, lights up all regions, he the king
  of kings; and I, having become Buddha, and a master of the Dharma, may I deliver mankind
  from old age and death! (4) </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;And I, on the strength of generosity, equanimity, virtue, forbearance, power,
  meditation and absorption, undertake here the first and best duties, and shall become a
  Buddha, the saviour of all beings. (5) </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;And I, seeking for the knowledge of the best of the Blessed Ones, shall always
  worship many hundred thousands of kotis of Buddhas, endless like the sand of the Ganges,
  the incomparable lords. (6) </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Whatever worlds there are, similar (in number) to the sand of the Ganja, and the
  endless countries which exist besides, there everywhere I shall send out light, because I
  have attained such power^20. (7) </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;My land is (to be) noble, the first and the best; the Bodhi-tree excellent in
  this world^21. There is incomparable happiness arising from Nirvana, and this also I shall
  explain as vain. (8) </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Beings^22 come hither from the ten quarters; having arrived there they quickly

  strength and vigour. (9) </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;I, knowing the worlds of the ten quarters, possessed of absolute knowledge--they
  also always proclaim my thought! May I, gone to Avichi hell, always abide there, but I
  shall never cease to practise the power of prayer! [i. e. May I remain in hell, if I cease
  to pray.]&quot; (10) </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"># 5. 'Then, O Ananda, that Bhikshu Dharmakara, having praised the Bhagavat, the
  Tathagata Lokesvararaja, in his presence, with those Gathas, spoke thus: &quot;O Bhagavat,
  I wish to know the highest perfect knowledge. Again and again I raise and incline my
  thoughts towards the highest perfect knowledge. May therefore the Bhagavat, as a teacher,
  thus teach me the Dharma, that I may quickly know the highest perfect knowledge. May I
  become in the world a Tathagata, equal to the unequalled. And may the Bhagavat proclaim
  those signs by which I may comprehend the perfection of all good qualities of a Buddha
  country.&quot; </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'After this, O Ananda, the Bhagavat Lokesvararaja, the Tathagata, thus spoke to that

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">' He said: &quot;O Bhagavat, I could not do this, but the Bhagavat alone. Explain the

  thousand nayutas of kotis of Buddhas, together with the signs, indication, and
  description, desiring welfare, wishing for benefits, compassionate, full of compassion, so
  that there might never be an end of Buddha countries, having conceived great pity for all
  beings. The measure of life of that Tathagata was full forty kalpas. </FONT> </p>

  excellences and good qualities of those Buddha countries, of those eighty-one hundred
  thousand nayutas of kotis of Buddhas, and concentrating them all on one Buddha country,
  worshipped with his head the feet of the Bhagavat Lokesvararaja, the Tathagata, turned
  respectfully round him to the right, and walked away from the presence of this Bhagavat.
  And afterwards, for the space of five kalpas, he thus concentrated the perfection of all
  the excellences and good qualities of the Buddha countries, such as had never been known
  before in the ten quarters of the whole world, more excellent, and more perfect than any,
  and composed the most excellent prayer. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"># 7. 'Thus, O Ananda, that Bhikshu concentrated in his mind a perfection of a Buddha
  country eighty-one times more immeasurable, noble, and excellent than the perfection of
  the eighty-one hundred thousand nayutas of kotis of Buddha countries that had been told
  him by the Bhagavat Lokesvararaja, the Tathagata. And then, proceeding to where the
  Tathagata was, he worshipped the feet of the Bhagavat with his head, and said: &quot;O
  Bhagavat, the perfection of all the excellences and good qualities of the Buddha countries
  has been concentrated by me.&quot; </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'After this, O Ananda, the Tathagata Lokesvararaja thus spoke to the Bhikshu:

  before the Bhagavat Lokesvararaja, the Tathagata, and before the world including gods,

  and Asuras, was established in the attainment of the true promise. And proclaiming this
  purity of the Buddha country, this greatness and excellency of the Buddha country, and
  performing the duty of a Bodhisattva, he never conceived the remotest thoughts of lust,
  malevolence, and cruelty, during a hundred thousand nayutas of kotis of years,
  immeasurable, innumerable, inconceivable, incomparable, measureless, immense,
  inexpressible; and he never conceived the idea of lust, malevolence, and cruelty, nay, he
  never conceived the idea of form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. He was gentle, charming

  wishes, satisfied, retired, not evil, not foolish, not suspicious, not crooked, not
  wicked, not deceitful, tender^34, kindly speaking, always zealous, docile in the searching
  after the pure Dharma. And for the good of all beings, he recited the great prayer,
  showing respect to friends, teachers, masters, the Sangha, the Dharma, and Buddha, always
  girded for the performance of the duties of the Bodhisattva, righteous, gentle, not
  deceitful, not flattering, virtuous, a leader for the sake of rousing others to perform
  all good laws, producing by his activity the ideas of emptiness, causelessness, and

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'Then, performing the duties of a Bodhisattva, after having given up all speaking
  which, when spoken, serves to injure one's self or others or both, he employed only such
  speech as served the pleasure and benefit of himself, others, or both. And he was so wise
  that, when entering into capitals, kingdoms, countries, towns, cities, and villages, he
  was always perfectly restrained with regard to all objects of sense. Performing himself
  the duties of the Bodhisattva without interruption, he walked himself in the highest
  perfection (paramita) of liberality, and he also roused others to walk in the same. And
  himself walking in the highest perfections of knowledge, meditation, strength, patience,
  and virtue, he roused others also to walk in the same. And he has collected so large a
  stock of merit that, wherever he is born, there arise for him many hundreds of thousands
  of nayutas of kotis of treasures from out the earth. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'By him, while he was thus performing the duties of a Bodhisattva, immeasurable and
  innumerable hundreds of thousands of nayutas of kotis of beings were established in
  perfect enlightenment, of whom it is not easy to know the limit by means of speech. So
  many immeasurable and innumerable holy Buddhas were honoured, revered, esteemed, and
  worshipped, and enabled to touch whatever causes pleasure, such as cloaks, alms-bowls,
  couches, seats, refreshments, medicines, and other furniture. It is not easy to know the
  limit by pointing it out in words, as to how many beings were established by him in the
  noble families of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, ministers, householders, and merchants. In the
  same manner they were established in the sovereignty of Jambudvipa (India), and they were
  established in the character of Kakravartins, Lokapalas, Sakras, Suyamas, Sutushitas,
  Sunirmitas,Vasavartins, Devaragas, and Mahabrahmans. So many immeasurable and innumerable
  Buddhas were honoured, revered, esteemed, and worshipped and requested to turn the wheel
  of the Dharma, of whom it is not easy to know the limit by means of words.

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'And he collected such virtue, that out of his mouth, while performing the duties of a
  Bodhisattva, during immeasurable, innumerable, inconceivable, incomparable, immense,
  measureless, inexpressible kotis of kalpas, there breathed a sweet and more than heavenly
  smell of sandal-wood. From all the pores of his hair there arose the smell of lotus, and
  he was pleasing to everybody, gracious and beautiful, endowed with the fulness of the best
  bright colour^35. As his body was adomed with all the good signs and marks, there arose
  from the pores (of his hair) and from the palms of his hands all sorts of precious
  ornaments in the shape of all kinds of cloaks and vestments, in the shape of all kinds of
  flowers, incense, scents, garlands, ointments, umbrellas, flags, and banners, and in the
  shape of all kinds of instrumental music. And there appeared also, streaming forth from
  the palms of his hands, all kinds of viands and drink, food, hard and soft, and
  sweetmeats, and all kinds of enjoyments and pleasures. Thus then that Bhikshu Dharmakara,

  himself, and teach the Dharma?' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Bhagavat said: 'Not indeed, O Ananda, has that Tathagata passed away, nor has he
  not yet come, but the Tathagata, the holy, after having obtained the highest perfect

  quarter, in the Buddha country, distant from this world by a hundred thousand nayutas of
  kotis of Buddha countries, in the world which is called Sukhavati, being called Amitabha,
  the Tathagata, holy and fully enlightened. He is surrounded by innumerable Bodhisattvas,
  and worshipped by endless Sravakas, and in possession of the endless perfection of his

  kotis of Buddha countries, so many hundred thousands of kotis of Buddha countries, so many
  hundred thousands of nayutas of kotis of Buddha countries. But indeed, O Ananda, to put it
  briefly, a hundred thousand nayutas of kotis of Buddha countries, equal to the sands of
  the river Ganges, are always lighted up, in the eastern quarter, by the light of that
  Bhagavat Amitabha. Thus on every side in the southern, western, northern quarter, in the
  zenith and nadir, in every one of these quarters, there are a hundred thousand nayutas of
  kotis of Buddha countries, like the sands of the river Ganges, always lighted up by the
  light of that Bhagavat Amitabha, excepting the Buddhas, the Bhagavats, who, through the
  practice of their former prayers, have lighted up the world by their own light, which is a
  fathom in length, or by their light which is one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty,
  thirty, forty, or fifty yojanas in length, or a hundred or thousand or hundred thousand
  yojanas in length, until their brightness reaches many hundred thousand nayutas of kotis
  of yojanas in length. There is not, O Ananda, any case of likeness, by which the extent of
  the light of that Tathagata Amitabha could be understood. Hence, O Ananda, for that reason
  that Tathagata is called Amitabha (possessed of infinite light), and he is called
  Amitaprabha (possessed of infinite splendour), Amitaprabhasa (possessed of infinite
  brilliancy), Asamaptabrabha (whose light is never finished), Asangataprabha (whose light
  is not conditioned), Prabhasikhotsrishtaprabha (whose light proceeds from flames of

  Apratihatarasmiragaprabha (whose light has the colour of unimpeded rays), Rajaniyaprabha

  (possessed of light that cannot be stopped), Ativiryaprabha (possessed of extremely

  Abhibuyanarendrabhutrayendraprabha^37 (possessed of light greater than that of the lords
  of men, nay, the lords of the three worlds), Srantasankayendusuryajihmikaranaprabha

  Abhibhuyalokapalasakrabrahmasuddhavasamahesvarasarvadevajihmikaranapraba (possessed of

  these things are immeasurable, innumerable, inconceivable, and endless, that is, first,
  the greatness of the excellence of the light of that Tathagata Amitabha, the Bhagavat, and
  secondly, the unsurpassed light of the knowledge possessed by the Tathagata (by myself).
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#13. 'And, O Ananda, the assembly of the hearers of that Tathagata Amitabha is
  immeasurable, so that it is not easy to learn its measure, so as to be able to say, there
  are so many kotis of the hearers, so many hundreds, thousands, hundred-thousands,
  kankaras, vimbaras, nayutas(?), ayutas, akshobhyas, vivahas (masc.), srotas (?), ogas^40,
  so many periods, called immeasurable, innumerable, countless, incomparable, inconceivable.
  Now, for instance, O Ananda, the Bhikshu Maudgalyayana having obtained miraculous power,
  might, if he wished, count^41 in one day and night, how many kinds of stars there are in
  the universal world. Then, let there be a hundred thousand nayutas of kotis of such men,
  endowed with miraculous powers, and let them do nothing else but count the first company
  (only) of the hearers of the Tathagata Amitabha, during a hundred thousand nayutas of
  kotis of years, and yet by them thus counting even the hundredth part would not be
  counted, even the thousandth, even the hundred thousandth nay, not even so far as the
  minutest part, or likeness, or approach^42 towards it would have been counted.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'Thus for instance, O Ananda, a man might throw out from the great ocean, which is not
  to be measured across by less than eighty-four thousand yojanas, one single drop of water
  by the sharp end of hair, which is divided a hundred times. What do you think then,
  Ananda, which would be greater, one drop of water which has been thrown up by the sharp
  pointed hair divided a hundred times, or the mass of water left in the great ocean?'
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Ananda said: 'Even a thousand yojanas, O Bhagavat, would be a small portion of the
  great ocean, how much more then one drop of water thrown out by the sharp pointed hair
  divided a hundred times!' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Bhagavat said : 'As that one drop of water, exactly so large (so small in proportion)
  was the first company of the hearers. And let there be reckoning made by those Bhikshus,
  who are like Maudgalyayana, counting for a hundred thousand nayutas of kotis of years, and
  yet, as to the mass of water left in the great ocean, it would even then have to be
  considered as not counted. How much more with regard to the second, third, and the rest of
  the companies of the hearers! Therefore the mass of hearers of the Bhagavat is endless and
  boundless, and receives the name of &quot;immeasurable and innumerable.&quot;
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#14. 'And, O Ananda, the length of the life of that Bhagavat Amitabha, the Tathagata,
  is immeasurable, so that it is not easy to know its length, so as to be able to say (that
  it comprises) so many hundreds of kalpas, so many thousands of kalpas, so many hundred
  thousands of kalpas, so many kotis of kalpas, so many hundreds of kotis of kalpas, so many
  thousands of kotis of kalpas, so many hundred thousands of kotis of kalpas, so many
  hundred thousands of nayutas of kotis of kalpas. Therefore, O Ananda, the limit of the
  measure of the life of that Bhagavat is immeasurable indeed. Therefore that Tathagata is
  called Amitayus. </FONT> </p>

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After this, the blessed Ananda spoke thus to the Bhagavat: 'But in that case, O

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Bhagavat said: 'Here, you see, the result of works and the outcome of works are
  inconceivable. But to the blessed Buddhas the position of Buddhas is not inconceivable,
  while to thee the holy and miraculous power of virtuous beings, whose stock of merit has
  become ripened, seems inconceivable.' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Ananda said: 'I had no doubt on this, no difference of opinion, or hesitation; on the

  are great rivers there, one yojana in breadth; there are rivers up to twenty, thirty,
  forty, fifty yojanas in breadth, and up to twelve yojanas in depth. All these rivers are
  delightful, carrying water of different sweet odour, carrying bunches of flowers adorned
  with various gems, resounding with sweet voices. ^45 And, O Ananda, there proceeds from an
  instrument which consists of hundred thousand kotis of parts, which embodies heavenly
  music and is played by clever people, the same delightful sound which proceeds from those
  great rivers, the sound which is deep, unknown, incomprehensible, clear, pleasant to the
  ear, touching the heart, beloved, sweet, delightful, never tiring, never disagreeable,
  pleasant to hear, as if it always said, &quot;Non-eternal, peaceful, unreal.&quot; Such a
  sound comes to be heard by these beings. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'And again, O Ananda, the borders of those great rivers on both sides are filled with
  jewel trees of various scents, from which bunches of flowers, leaves, and branches of all
  kinds hang down. And if the beings, who are on the borders of those rivers, wish to enjoy
  sport full of heavenly delights, the water rises to the ankle only after they have stepped
  into the rivers, if they wish it to be so; or if they wish it, the water rises to their
  knees, to their hips, to their sides, and to their ears. And heavenly pleasures arise.
  Again, if the beings then wish the water to be cold, it is cold; if they wish it to be
  hot, it is hot; if they wish it to be hot and cold, it is hot and cold, according to their
  pleasure. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'And those great rivers flow along, full of water scented with the best perfumes of the
  Uragasara sandal-wood, of Tagaras, Kalanusarin (dark, fragrant sandal-wood) trees, Agarus,
  and heavenly Tamalapattras; covered with flowers of the white waterlilies, and heavenly
  Utpalas, Padmas, Kumudas, and Pundarikas;. full of delightful sounds of peacocks,
  sparrows, kunalas, cuckoos, sarikas, parrots, ducks, geese, herons, cranes, swans^46 and
  others; with small islands inhabited by flocks of birds, created by the Tathagata; adorned
  with fields, full of metals; with fords on which it is easy to drink, free from mud, and
  covered with gold dust. And when these beings there desire, thinking what kind of wishes
  should be fulfilled for them, then exactly such wishes are fulfilled for them according to
  the Dharma^47. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'And, O Ananda, the sound which rises from that water is delightful, and the whole
  Buddha country is aroused by it. And if beings, who stand on the borders of the river,
  wish that the sound should not come within their ear-shot, then it does not come within
  their ear-shot, even if they are possessed of the heavenly ear. And whatever sound a man
  wishes to hear, exactly that delightful sound he hears, as for instance, the sound
  &quot;Buddha, Dharma (the Law), Sangha (the Church), the Paramitas (highest perfections),
  the Bhumis (stages), the Balas (powers), Vaisaradya (perfections), Avenikabuddhadharma
  (freedom from attachment), Pratisamvit (consciousness); Sunyata (emptiness), Animitta
  (unconditioned), Apranihita (free from desire), Anabhisamskara (not made), Ajata (not
  born), Anutpada (without origin), Abhava (not being), and Nirodha (cessation); Santa,
  prasanta, and upasanta (peace); Mahamaitri (great love), Mahakaruna (great pity),
  Mahamudita (great rejoicing), and Mahopeksha (great forgiveness); Anutpattikadharmakshanti
  (resignation to consequences which have not yet arisen), and Abhishekabhumipratilambha
  (attainment of the royal stage).&quot; </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'And having heard these sounds, everybody feels the highest delight and pleasure
  accompanied by retirement, passionlessness, quiet, cessation, law, and a stock of merit
  leading to the perfect knowledge. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'And O Ananda, there is nowhere in that Sukhavati world any sound of sin, obstacle,
  misfortune, distress, and destruction; there is nowhere any sound of pain, even the sound
  of perceiving what is neither pain nor pleasure is not there, O Ananda, how much less the
  sound of pain. For that reason, O Ananda, that world is called Sukhavati, shortly, but not
  in full. For, O Ananda, the whole kalpa would come to an end, while the different causes
  of the pleasure of the world Sukhavati are being praised, and even then the end of those
  causes of happiness could not be reached. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#19. 'And again, O Ananda, the beings, who have been and will be born in that world
  Sukhavati, will be endowed with such colour, strength, vigour, height and breadth,
  dominion, accumulation of virtue^48; with such enjoyments of dress, ornaments, gardens,
  palaces, and pavilions; and such enjoyments of touch, taste, smell, and sound; in fact
  with all enjoyments and pleasures, exactly like the Paranirmitavasavartin gods.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'And again, O Ananda, in that world Sukhavati, beings do not take food consisting of
  gross materials of gravy or molasses; but whatever food they desire, such food they
  perceive, as if it were taken, and become delighted in body and mind. Yet they need not
  put it into their mouth. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'And if, after they are satisfied, they wish different kinds of perfumes, then with
  these very heavenly kinds of perfumes the whole Buddha country is scented. And whosoever
  wishes to perceive there such perfume, every perfume of every scent of the Gandharvaraja
  does always reach his nose^49. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'And in the same manner, if they desire musical instruments, banners, flags, umbrellas,
  cloaks, powders, ointments, garlands, and scents, then the whole Buddha country shines
  with such things. If they desire cloaks of different colours and many hundred thousand
  colours, then with these very best cloaks the whole Buddha country shines. And the people
  feel themselves covered with them. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'And if they desire such ornaments, as for instance, head-ornaments, ear-ornaments,
  neck-ornaments, hand and foot ornaments, namely, diadems, earrings, bracelets, armlets,
  necklaces, chains, earjewels, seals, gold strings, girdles, gold nets^50, pearl nets,
  jewel nets, nets of bells made of gold and jewels, then they see that Buddha country
  shining with such ornaments adorned with many hundred thousand jewels, that are fastened
  to ornament-trees. And they perceive themselves to be adorned with these ornaments.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'And if they desire a palace, with colours and emblems of such and such height and
  width, adorned with hundred thousand gates made with different jewels, covered with
  different heavenly flowers^51, full of couches strewn with beautiful cushions, then
  exactly such a palace appears before them. And in these delightful palaces they dwell,
  play, sport, walk about, being honoured, and surrounded by seven times seven thousands of
  Apsarases. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#20. 'And in that world, there is no difference between gods and men, except when they
  are spoken of in ordinary and imperfect parlance as gods and men. And, O Ananda, as a low
  man and impotent man, before the face of the mighty king, is neither bright, nor warm, nor
  brilliant, nor is he self-confident and radiant, thus Sakra, king of the Devas, if before
  the face of the Paranirmitavasavartin gods, is neither bright, nor warm, nor brilliant,
  namely, with regard to his gardens, palaces, dresses, ornaments, his dominion, his
  perfection, his miraculous power, or his supremacy, his comprehension of the Dharma, and
  his full enjoyment of the Dharma. And, O Ananda, as the Paranirmitavasavartin gods are
  there, thus men must be considered in the world Sukhavati. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#21. 'And again, O Ananda, in that world Sukhavati, when the time of forenoon has come,
  the winds are greatly agitated and blowing everywhere in the four quarters. And they shake
  and drive many beautiful, graceful, and many-coloured stalks of the gem trees, which are
  perfumed with sweet heavenly scents, so that many hundred beautiful flowers of delightful
  scent fall down on the great earth, which is all full of jewels. And with these flowers
  that Buddha country is adorned on every side seven fathoms deep. As a clever man might
  spread out a flower-bed on the earth and make it even with both his hands, beautiful and
  charming, even thus with those flowers of various scents and colours that Buddha country
  is shining on every side seven fathoms deep. And these many flowers are soft, pleasant to
  touch, if one may use a comparison, like Kakilindika (some kind of soft substance). If one
  puts one's foot on them, they sink down four inches; if one raises one's foot, they rise
  again four inches. When the time of the forenoon has gone again, those flowers vanish
  without leaving anything behind. Then that Buddha country is again clean, pleasant,
  beautiful, and without fading flowers. The winds blow again everywhere in the four
  quarters, and scatter down fresh flowers as before. And as it is in the forenoon, so it is
  at noon, at twilight, in the first, middle, and last watch of the night. And the beings,
  if touched by those winds which blow perfume with various scents, are as full of happiness
  as a Bhikshu (mendicant) who has obtained Nirvana. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#22. 'And in that Buddha country, O Ananda, no mention is ever made of the names of
  fire, sun, moon, planets, Nakshatras (constellations), and stars, or of blinding darkness.
  There is no mention even of day and night, except in the conversation of the Tathagata.
  Nor is there any idea of predial property belonging to monasteries. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#23. 'And again, O Ananda, in that world Sukhavati at the proper time clouds full of
  heavenly perfumed water pour down heavenly flowers of all colours; heavenly seven jewels,
  heavenly sandalwood-powder, and heavenly umbrellas, flags, and banners are poured down.
  And in the sky, the heavenly flowers of all colours, and heavenly canopies are held,
  likewise heavenly excellent umbrellas and all kinds of ornaments, heavenly musical
  instruments are played, and heavenly Apsarases dance. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#24. 'And again, O Ananda, in that Buddha country whatever beings have been born, and
  are being born, and will be born, are always constant in absolute truth, till they have
  reached Nirvana. And why is that? Because there is no room or mention there of the other
  two divisions (rasis), such as beings not constant or constant in falsehood.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'On this wise, O Ananda, that world is briefly called Sukhavati, not at full length.
  Even a kalpa, O Ananda, would come to an end, while the causes of happiness which exist in
  that world Sukhavati are being praised, and yet it would be impossible to reach the end of
  them.' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">25. Then the Bhagavat at that time spoke the following verses^52:
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'Thus, O Ananda, the world Sukhavati is endowed with immeasurable good qualities and
  excellences. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#26. 'And again, O Ananda, in the ten quarters, and in each of them, in all the Buddha
  countries equal in number to the sand of the Ganges, the blessed Buddhas equal in number
  to the sand of the Ganges, glorify the name of the blessed Amitabha, the Tathagata, they
  preach his fame, they proclaim his glory, they extol his virtue. And why ? Because all
  beings who hear the name of the blessed Amitabha, and having heard it, raise their thought
  with joyful longing, even for once only, will not turn away again from the highest perfect
  knowledge. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#27. 'And before the eyes of those beings, O Ananda, who again and again think of the
  Tathagata reverently and who make the great and unmeasured stock of good works grow,
  turning their thought towards Bodhi (knowledge), and who pray to be born in that world,
  Amitabha, the Tathagata, holy and fully enlightened, when the time of their death has
  approached, will appear, surrounded by many companies of Bhikshus and honoured by them.
  And then these beings, having seen the Bhagavat, their thoughts filled with joy, will,
  when they have died, be born in that world of Sukhavati. And if, O Ananda, any son or
  daughter of a good family should wish --What?--How then may I see that Tathagata Amitabha
  visibly, then he must raise his thought on to the highest perfect knowledge, he must
  direct his thought with perseverance and excessive desire towards that Buddha country, and
  direct the stock of his good works towards being born there. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"># 28. ' But before the eyes of those who do not care much about the Tathagata Amitabha,
  and who do not vigorously increase the great and unmeasured stock of their good works, the
  Tathagata Amitabha, holy and fully enlightened, will appear, at the time of death, with
  the company of Bhikshus, in breadth and height and form and beauty, very like (the
  former), and very like (the real Tathagata), but only created by thought. And they,
  through their meditation that dwells on perceiving the sight of the Tathagata, and with
  unfailing memory, will, when they have died, be born in the same Buddha country.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#29. 'And again, O Ananda, those beings who meditate on the Tathagata by giving him the
  ten thoughts, and who will direct their desire towards that Buddha country, and who will
  feel satisfaction when the profound doctrines are being preached, and who will not fall
  off, nor despair, nor fail, but will meditate on that Tathagata, if it were by one thought
  only, and will direct their desire toward that Buddha country, they also will see the
  Tathagata Amitabha, while they are in a dream, they will be born in the world Sukhavati,
  and will never turn away from the highest perfect knowledge. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#30. 'And, O Ananda, after thus seeing the cause and effect, the Tathagatas of the ten
  quarters, in immeasurable and innumerable worlds, glorify the name of the Tathagata
  Amitabha, preach his fame, and proclaim his praise. And again, O Ananda, in that Buddha
  country, Bodhisattvas equal in number to the sand of the Ganges approach, from the ten

  before him, to worship him, to consult him, and likewise in order to see that company of
  Bodhisattvas, and the different kinds of perfection in the multitude of ornaments and

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#31. Then at that time, the Bhagavat, in order to illustrate this matter in fuller
  measure, recited these verses^53: </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. 'As there are Buddha countries equal to the sand of the river Ganges in the eastern

  They consider in many ways that they should worship (Buddhas) with such and such flowers,
  incense, lamps, scents, garlands, ointments, powder, cloaks, umbrellas, flags, banners,
  ensigns, music, concerts, and musical instruments; and, as soon as they have considered
  this, there arise also on their hands exactly such materials for every kind of worship.
  And while performing worship for those blessed Buddhas with those materials, beginning
  with flowers and ending with musical instruments, they lay up for themselves much
  immeasurable and innumerable merit. Again, if they wish that such handfulls of flowers
  should be produced on their hands, then such handfulls of heavenly flowers, of different
  colours, of many colours, of different scents, are produced on their hands as soon as
  thought of. They shower again and again such handfulls of flowers upon those blessed
  Buddhas. And the very smallest handfull of flowers, being thrown on high, appears above in
  the sky as an umbrella of flowers ten yojanas in circumference. And when the second has
  been thrown after it, the first does not fall down on the earth. There are handfulls of
  flowers there, which having been thrown up, appear in the sky as umbrellas of flowers
  twenty yojanas in circumference. </FONT> </p>

  having caused a great and immeasurable and innumerable stock of good works to ripen, and
  having worshipped many hundred thousand nayutas of kotis of Buddhas, turn again to the
  world Sukhavati in one morning, through the favour of practising the former prayers of the

  and walking through that Buddha country feel neither pleasure nor pain; stepping forward
  they have no desire, and with desire they do not step forward. They give no thought to any

  explanation of causes, endowed with the power of explaining the Dharma (or things such as
  they really are), clever in taking and refusing, clever in leading and not leading, clever
  in resting^64, they, being regardless of worldly stories, derive true pleasures from
  stories transcending the world. They are clever in examining all things, familiar with the
  knowledge of the cessation of the working of all things, perceiving even what cannot be
  seen, caring for nothing, attached to nothing, without cares, without pain, free without
  clinging to anything, free from impurity^65, of blameless behaviour, not clinging to
  anything, intent on the deep or profound laws, they do not sink, elevated to the entrance

  others, free from self-confidence. </FONT> </p>

  light and splendour, they are like the colour of molten gold; by their patiently bearing
  the good and evil deeds of all beings, they are like the earth; by their cleaning and
  carrying off the taint^66 of all sins, they are like water; by their burning the evil of
  pride^67 in anything, they are like the king of fire ; by not clinging to anything, they
  are like the wind; by pervading all things and yet not caring for anything, they are like
  the ether; by not being tainted by the whole world, they are like lotuses; by their
  shouting forth the Dharma, they are like the great cloud at the rainy season; by showering

  not being shaken by any calumniators, they are like the (Sumeru), the king of mountains;
  by their feeling of unlimited love, they are like the sky; by their precedence, owing to

  averse to our obtaining difficult things, they are like the Udumbara flowers; calm like
  elephants^68, because their senses are neither crooked nor shaken; clever in decision,
  full of the sweet flavour of patience; without envy, because they do not hanker after the
  happiness of others; wise, because in their search after the Dharma, never tired of

  looking for wisdom, not foolish, faultless, passionless, pure, refined, not greedy, fond

  energetic, bashful, orderly, fearless^69, full of knowledge, happy, Pleasant to live with,
  obliging, enlightening the world^70, free from sorrow, free from taint, having left off
  the winking of the eye, possessing lightly acquired knowledge, strong in reasoning, strong
  in prayer, not crooked, not perverse; then, having accumulated a hundred thousand nayutas
  of kotis of lakshas^71 of virtue, delivered from the thorns of pride, free from illusion,
  hatred, and passion; pure, devoted to what is pure, famous by the Jina-power, learned in
  the world, elevated by their purified knowledge, sons of the Jina, endowed with the vigour
  of thought, heroes, firm, unselfish^72, free from faults, unequalled, free from anger,
  collected, noble, heroes, bashful, energetic, possessed of memory, understanding, and
  prudence; sending forth the weapons of knowledge, possessed of purity, shining, free from

  are the beings in that Buddha country, stated briefly. But if the Tathagatas should
  describe them fully, even in a length of life that should last for a hundred thousand
  nayutas of kotis of kalpas, yet the end of the virtues of those good people would not be
  reached, and yet there would be no failure of the self-confidence of the Tathagata. And
  why? Because, O Ananda, both are indeed inconceivable and incomparable, that is, first,
  the virtues of those Bodhisattvas, and secondly, the unsurpassed light of knowledge of the
  Tathagata^73. </FONT> </p>

  spotless and pure name, famed in every quarter of the whole world with its ten quarters,
  the blessed Buddhas, equal to the grains of the sand of the river Ganges, speaking and

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After this, the blessed Ananda said this to the Bhagavat : 'I wish, O Bhagavat, to see

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At that moment this speech was spoken by the blessed Ananda, and immediately that
  Amitabha, the Tathagata, holy and fully enlightened, let such a ray of light go out of the

  great Merus, Mukilindas, great Mukilindas, Chakravadas, great Chakravadas, or erections,
  or pillars, trees, woods, gardens, palaces, belonging to the gods and men, exist

  Garudas, Kinnaras, Mahoragas, men and not-men, in this Buddha country, saw at that time
  that Amitabha, the Tathagata, holy and fully enlightened, like the Sumeru, the king of
  mountains, elevated above all countries, surpassing all quarters, shining, warming,
  glittering, blazing; and they saw that great mass of Bodhisattvas, and that company of
  Bhikshus, that is, by the grace of Buddha, from the pureness of that light.

  exactly the same manner there is neither mark nor sign whatever to be seen in that Buddha

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And that Bhagavat Amitabha, the Tathagata, holy and fully enlightened, overshadowing

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Ajita said: 'I do not, O Bhagavat, perceive even one difference, so far as the men in

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He said: 'As gods called Trayastrimsas or Yamas, having entered into palaces of fifty
  or hundred or five hundred yojanas in extent, are playing, sporting, walking about,

  excellent lotus-flowers in the world Sukhavati. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#41. 'Again there are, O Bhagavat, beings who, being born miraculously, appear sitting
  cross-legged in the lotus-flowers. What is there, O Bhagavat, the cause, what the reason,
  that some dwell within the calyx, while others, being born miraculously, appear sitting
  cross-legged in the lotus-flowers?' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Bhagavat said: 'Those Bodhisattvas, O Ajita, who, living in other Buddha countries,
  entertain doubt about being born in the world Sukhavati, and with that thought amass a
  stock of merit, for them there is the dwelling within the calyx. Those, on the contrary,
  who are filled with faith, and being free from doubt, amass a stock of merit in order to
  be born in the world Sukhavati, and conceive, believe, and trust in the perfect knowledge
  of the blessed Buddhas, they, being born miraculously, appear sitting cross-legged in the
  flowers of the lotus. And those noble-minded Bodhisattvas, O Ajita, who, living in other
  Buddha countries, raise their thought in order to see Amitabha, the Tathagata, holy and
  fully enlightened, who never entertain a doubt, believe in the perfect knowledge of Buddha
  and in their own stock of merit, for them, being born miraculously, and appearing
  cross-legged, there is in one minute, such a body as that of other beings who have been
  born there long before. See, O Ajita, the excellent, immeasurable, unfailing, unlimited
  wisdom, that namely for their own benefit they are deprived during five hundred years of
  seeing Buddhas, seeing Bodhisattvas, hearing the Dharma, speaking about the Dharma (with
  others), and thus collecting a stock of merit; they are indeed deprived of the successful
  attainment of every stock of merit, and that, through their forming ideas tainted with
  doubt. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'And, O Ajita, there might be a dungeon belonging to an anointed Kshatriya king, inlaid
  entirely with gold and beryl, in which cushions, garlands, wreaths and strings are fixed,
  having canopies of different colours and kind, covered with silk cushions, scattered over
  with various flowers and blossoms, scented with excellent scents, adorned with arches,
  courts, windows, pinnacles, fire-places, and terraces, covered with nets of bells of the
  seven kinds of gems, having four angles, four pillars, four doors, four stairs; and the
  son of that king having been thrown into the dungeon for some misdeed is there, bound with
  a chain made of the Jambunada gold. And suppose there is a couch prepared for him, covered
  with many woollen cloths, spread over with cotton and feather cushions, having Kalinga
  coverings, and carpets, together with coverlids^75, red on both sides, beautiful and
  charming. There he might be then either sitting or resting. And there might be brought to
  him much food and drink, of various kinds, pure and well prepared. What do you think, O
  Ajita, would the enjoyment be great for that prince?' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Ajita said: 'Yes^76, it would be great, O Bhagavat.'
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Ajita, would he even taste it there, and
  notice it, or would he feel any satisfaction from it?' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He said: 'Not indeed, O Bhagavat; but on the contrary, when he had been led away by the
  king and thrown into the dungeon, he would only wish for deliverance from there. He would
  seek for the nobles, princes, ministers, women^77, elders (rich merchants), householders,
  and lords of castles, who might deliver him from that dungeon. Moreover, O Bhagavat, there
  is no pleasure for that prince in that dungeon, nor is he liberated, until the king shows
  him favour.' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Bhagavat said: 'Thus, O Ajita, it is with those Bodhisattvas who, having fallen
  into doubt, amass a stock of merit, but doubt the knowledge of Buddha. They are born in
  that world Sukhavati, through the hearing of Buddha's name, and through the serenity of
  thought only; they do not, however, appear sitting cross-legged in the flowers of the
  lotus, being born miraculously, but dwell only in the calyx of the lotus-flowers. Moreover
  for them there exist ideas of palaces and gardens^78. There is no discharge, there is no
  phlegm or mucus, there is nothing disagreeable to the mind. But they are deprived of
  seeing Buddhas, hearing the Dharma, seeing Bodhisattvas, speaking about and ascertaining
  the Dharma, (gathering) any (new) stock of merit, and practising the Dharma, during five
  hundred years. Moreover they do not rejoice there or perceive satisfaction. But they wish
  to remove one another, and then they step out behind. And it is not known whether their
  exit takes place above, below, or across. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'See, O Ajita, there might be worshippings of many hundred thousand nayutas of kotis of
  Buddhas during those five hundred years, and also many, immense, innumerable, immeasurable
  stocks of merit to be amassed. But all this they destroy by the fault of doubt. See, O
  Ajita, to how great an injury the doubt of the Bodhisattvas leads. Therefore now, O Ajita,
  after the Bodhisattvas without doubting have quickly raised their thoughts towards the
  Bodhi, in order to obtain power of conferring happiness for the benefit of all creatures,
  their stock of merit should be turned towards their being born in the world Sukhavati,
  where the blessed Amitabha, the Tathagata, holy and fully enlightened, dwells.'
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#42. After these words, the Bodhisattva Ajita thus spoke to the Bhagavat: 'O Bhagavat,
  will the Bodhisattvas, who have gone away from this Buddha country, or from the side of
  other blessed Buddhas, be born in the world Sukhavati?' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Bhagavat said: 'Indeed, O Ajita, seventy-two nayutas of kotis of Bodhisattvas are
  gone away from this Buddha country, who will be born in the world Sukhavati; Bodhisattvas,
  who will never return, thanks to the stock of merit, which they have accumulated under
  many hundred thousand nayutas of kotis of Buddhas. What then shall be said of those with
  smaller stocks of merit^79? </FONT> </p>

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">13. Twenty-five kotis of Bodhisattvas, who have obtained strength, having gone to one

  thousand nayutas of kotis of kalpas^80, will be born in the world Sukhavati from the place

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">14. Twelve kotis of Bodhisattvas will be born in the world Sukhavati from the place of

  sixty-nine kotis of Bodhisattvas will be born in the world Sukhavati, in order to see the
  Tathagata Amitabha, to bow before him, to worship him, to ask questions of him, and to
  consult him. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'For this reason, O Ajita, I might proclaim during a full nayuta of kotis of kalpas the
  names of those Tathagatas, from whom the Bodhisattvas proceed in order to see that
  Tathagata Amitabha in the world Sukhavati, to bow before him, and to worship him, and yet
  the end could not be reached. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#43. 'See, O Ajita, what easy gains are gained by those beings who will hear the name
  of the Tathagata Amitabha, holy and fully enlightened. Nor will those beings be of little
  faith^81, who will obtain at least one joyful thought of that Tathagata and of this
  treatise of the Dharma. Therefore now, O Ajita, I invite you, and command you to proclaim
  this treatise of the Dharma, before the world together with the gods. Having plunged into
  the vast universe full of fire, no one ought to turn back, if he has but once conceived
  the thought of going across. And why ? Because kotis of Bodhisattvas indeed, O Ajita,
  return from the highest perfect knowledge, on account of not hearing such treatises of the
  Dharma as this. Therefore, from a wish for this treatise of the Dharma, a great effort
  should be made to hear, learn, and remember it, and to study it for the sake of fully
  grasping it and widely making it known. A good copy of it should be kept, after it has
  been copied in a book, if only during one night and day, or even during the time necessary
  for milking a cow. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'The name of Master should be given to a teacher who desires to conduct quickly
  innumerable beings to the state of never returning from the highest perfect knowledge,
  namely, in order that they may see the Buddha country of that blessed Amitabha, the
  Tathagata, and to acquire the excellent perfection of the array of good qualities peculiar
  to his own Buddha country. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'And, O Ajita, such beings will have easily gained their gains who, having amassed a
  stock of merit, having performed service under former Jinas, and having been guided by
  Buddhas, shall hear in future, until the destruction of the good Dharma, such-like
  excellent treatises of the Dharma, treatises which are praised, eulogized, and approved of
  by all Buddhas, and convey quickly the great knowledge of omniscience. And those also who,
  when they have heard it, shall obtain excellent delight and pleasure, and will learn,
  retain, recite and grasp, and wisely preach it to others, and be delighted by its study,
  or, having copied it at least, will worship it, will certainly produce much good work, so
  that it is difficult to count it. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'Thus indeed, O Ajita, I have done what a Tathagata ought to do. It is now for you to
  devote yourself to it without any doubt. Do not doubt the perfect and unfailing knowledge
  of Buddha. Do not enter into the dungeon made of gems built up in every way. For indeed,
  the birth of a Buddha, O Ajita, is difficult to be met with, so is the instruction in the
  Dharma, and also a timely birth^82. O Ajita, the way to gain the perfection (piramita) of
  all stocks of merit has been proclaimed by me. Do now exert yourselves and move forward. O
  Ajita, I grant indeed a great favour to this treatise of the Dharma. Be valiant so that
  the laws of Buddhas may not perish or disappear. Do not break the command of the
  Tathagata.' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#44. Then at that time, the Bhagavat spoke these verses :
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. 'Such hearings of me will not be for people who have not done good; but those who
  are heroes and perfect, they will hear this speech. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2. 'And those by whom the Lord of the world, the enlightened and the light-giver, has
  been seen, and the law been heard reverentially, will obtain the highest joy.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">3. 'Low people of slothful minds cannot find any delight in the laws of Buddha; those
  who have worshipped in the Buddha countries learn the service of the Lords of the three
  worlds. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">4. 'As a blind man in darkness does not know the way, and much less can show it, so
  also he who is (only) a Sravaka^83 in the knowledge of Buddha; how then should beings who
  are ignorant! </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">5. 'The Buddha only knows the virtues of a Buddha; but not gods, Nagas, Asuras,
  Yakshas, and Sravakas (disciples); even for Anekabuddhas^84 there is no such way, as when
  the knowledge of a Buddha is being manifested. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">6. 'If all beings had attained bliss, knowing the highest meaning in pure wisdom, they
  would not in kotis of kalpas or even in a longer time tell all the virtues of one Buddha.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">7. 'Thereupon they would attain Nirvana, preaching for many kotis of kalpas, and yet
  the measure of the knowledge of a Buddha would not be reached, for such is the
  wonderfulness of the knowledge of the Jinas. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">8. 'Therefore a learned man of an intelligent race^85 who believes my words, after
  having perceived all paths of the knowledge of the Jinas, should utter speech, saying,
  &quot;Buddha is wise.&quot; </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">9. 'Now and then a man is found, now and then a Buddha appears, knowledge of the object
  of faith is acquired after a long time,--therefore one should strive to acquire (the
  knowledge of) the object (of faith)^86. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#45. And while this treatise of the Dharma was being delivered, twelve kotis of nayutas
  of beings obtained the pure and spotless eye of the Dharma with regard to Dharmas.
  Twenty-four hundred thousand nayutas of kotis of beings obtained the Anagamin^87 reward.
  Eight hundred Bhikshus had their thoughts delivered from faults so as to cling no more to
  anything. Twenty-five kotis of Bodhisattvas obtained resignation to things to come. And by
  forty hundred thousand nayutas of kotis of the human and divine race, thoughts such as had
  never risen before were turned toward the highest perfect knowledge, and their stocks of
  merit were made to grow toward their being born in the world Sukhavati, from a desire to
  see the Tathagata, the blessed Amitabha. And all of them having been born there, will in
  proper order be born in other worlds, as Tathagatas, called Manjusvara (sweet-voiced). And
  eighty kotis of nayutas having acquired resignation under the Tathagata Dipankara, never
  turning back again from the highest perfect knowledge, rendered perfect by the Tathagata
  Amitayus, practising the duties of former Bodhisattvas, will carry out, after they are
  born in the world Sukhavati, the duties enjoined in the former Pranidhanas (prayers).
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#46. At that time this universe (the three millions of worlds) trembled in six ways.
  And various miracles were seen. On earth everything was perfect, and human and divine
  instruments were played, and the shout of joy was heard as far as the world of the
  Akanishthas. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">#47. Thus spoke the Bhagavat enraptured, and the noble-minded Bodhisattva Ajita, and
  the blessed Ananda, the whole Assembly, and the world, with gods, men, spirits, mighty
  birds, and fairies, applauded the speech of the Bhagavat. The praise of the beauty of the
  excellences of Sukhavati, the country of the blessed Amitabha, the Tathagata, the entry of
  the Bodhisattva on the stage of 'never returning,' the story of Amitabha, the
  Mahayanasutra of the Description of Sukhavati is finished. </FONT> </p>

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">7. [in the state of a Mahanaga] This is left out here. Mahanaga, technical term for

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">9. [to ask the Tathagata this matter] One expects tathagatam etam artham.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">10. [might pile up] I have adopted the reading of B, in order to have a subject for
  apasamharet, but A C P read ananda. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">11. [that cannot be exceeded] I am not satisfied with this translation, but I do not
  think that gnana, even in Buddhist Sanskrit, could ever be used as a masculine, and I
  therefore take tathagatagnanah as a Bahurihi. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">12. [If] Read gnanah. Akankshan. </FONT> </p>

  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">19. [best of Buddhas] I translate buddhavara.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">20. [...such power] The text is obscure, Sanghavarman translates: 'My light will shine

  Childers, s.v. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">28. [the higher practice] Possibly the same as the uttarimagga, Arhatship.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">29. [Samantabhadra] See note at the end.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">30. [spoke these verses] The translation of these verses, owing to the imperfect state
  of the text, is in many places tentative only. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">31. [worthy of offerings] see verse 10. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">32. [King of treasures] A Naga king? </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">33. [worthy of equal offerings] See verse 1.

  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">36. [Anibandhaniyaprabha] This seems better than nibandhaniyaprabha, as printed in the
  text. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">37. [Abhibuyanarendrabhutrayendraprabha] This reading is conjectural and the
  translation doubtful. Perhaps the text was anabhibhuyanarendrabhutrayendra-prabhah.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">38. [beings of good disposition] Here the text adds (p. 30, l. 4)
  kalyakusalamiminevadvipramodyakarani. The whole sentence is unintelligible.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">39. [the Tathagata] This refers to the Bhagavat Shakyamuni himself, who speaks of
  himself as the Tathagata. What he means to say is that the light of Amitabha is infinite
  and that therefore even the Tathagata could not finish the description of it. Yet this
  would not detract from the infinite power of the Tathagata or diminish his vaisaradya
  because that power too is infinite. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">40. [....ogas] All these are names of fanciful measures.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">41. [....might, if he wished, count...] Nagarena, 'with an instrument' or 'by some
  clever contrivance.' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">42. [...or approach] See Kern's translation of the Saddharmapundarika, p. 317, note 2.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">43. [untimely births] These untimely births, i.e. being born out of time, when there
  are no Buddhas to listen to, are not mentioned in the first Pranidhana; nor the jewels.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">44.[on purpose] Cf. the eighth paragraph in the Smaller Sukhavati-vyuha.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">45. [And, O Ananda] Instead of tasam, it is better to read tatha.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">46. [...cranes, swans] The Tibetan translation puts these birds as follows: geese,
  swans, cranes, ducks, karandavas, parrots, grouse (kokilas), kunalas, kalavinkas, and
  peacocks. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">47. [...according to the Dharma] Instead of Dharmah, the Tibetan translator seems to
  have read Dharmavat. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">48. [accumulation of virtue] Here the text seems corrupt.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">49. [...does always reach his nose] The Tibetan translator seems to have read: tatra
  yas tam gandham agratukamo na bhavati, tasya sarvaso gandhasangna vasana ka na
  samudakarati. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">50. [gold nets] The Tibetan translation suggests the reading svarnajala.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">51. [...different heavenly flowers] Instead of pushpa the Tibetan translator seems to
  have read dushya, 'garment.' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">52. [...the following verses] The text of these verses is so corrupt that I thought it
  best to follow the example of the five Chinese translators, all of whom leave them out.
  They only repeat what was said before, that people might go on for ever praising the
  excellences of Sukhavaati, yet they would never reach the end of them, and that the merit
  of hearing even the name of Sukhavati is greater than all other blessings on earth. The
  best thing, however, is to have faith in Jina, and to drive away all doubt. The Tibetan
  translator gives a translation of seven verses, but his translation also seems as obscure
  as the original. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">53. [...recited these verses] In these verses there are again many doubtful passages
  which could be rendered tentatively only. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">54. [...this dream-like country] Maitra, 'love,' possibly 'kindness,' or was it
  kshetra? </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">55. [endless is his splendour] Amita asyabha?
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">56. [with devotion] The Tibetan translation has 'in the morning,' as if the text had
  been purvabhakta. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">57. [one birth only] Their present birth.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">58. [of their former births] 'Na' must be left out, or we must read nagatvajatismara.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">59. [well-ordered state of mind] The text of this passage is very imperfect in all the
  MSS. Comparing the sentence with the last sentence of Chapter XXXII, it might seem
  possible to read paripurnanunataya, or paripuryatayanunataya, for paripuryatmabhutaya. On
  suvibhakta, see Childers, s. v. vibhajati. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">60. [accompanied by omniscience] See the twenty-third Pranidhana.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">61. [no idea of property whatever] See the tenth Pranidahana.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">62. [Bodhyangas] Requisites for attaining the supreme knowledge of a
  Buddha.'--Childers, Pali Dictionary, p. 93 b. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">63. [the three elements] Probably the three dhatus, Kamadhatu, Rupadhatu, and
  Arupadhatu; see Childers, s.v. dhatu. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">64. [clever in resting] The text may originally have been sthanasthanakusalah.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">65. [free from impurity] The next words aparyasthayinah and abhijnasvamulasthayinah
  seem to have a technical meaning, but neither the Tibetan nor the Chinese translators give
  an intelligible rendering. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">66. [the taint] The Tibetan translation presupposes mala instead of mula.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">67. [the evil of pride] Mana, 'pride,' is one of the Klesas.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">68. [calm like elephants] The Tibetan translator seems to have read sagaravat, instead
  of nagavat. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">69. [fearless] The Tibetan translation seems to have read ratnakarasadrisah.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">70. [enlightening the world] If the same as nirgahana.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">71. [lakshas] The Tibetan translation has Buddha for laksha.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">72. [unselfish] Asamah in the Tibetan translation.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">73. [knowledge of the Tathagata] For these passages, see the end of Chapter XII.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">74. [charming parks] A substantive seems to be wanting to which all these adjectives
  would refer. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">75. [coverlids] The text is corrupt. One might begin a new word with
  sottarapadakkhadah. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">76. [Yes] One expects, No. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">77. [women] Stryagara, like the German Frauenzimmer.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">78. [palaces and gardens] They imagine they are living in palaces and gardens.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">79. [smaller stocks of merit] What is meant is that their number is much larger.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">80. [...kotis of kalpas] Sanghavarman's translation of this passage is: 'Within seven
  days they can take hold of the firm conditions (dharmas) practised by a noble-minded one
  during hundred thousands of kotis of kalpas.' Bodhiruchi's is: 'Within seven days they can
  cause beings to separate from their state of transmigration during hundred thousands of
  nayutas of kotis.' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">81. [be of little faith] Hinadhimuktika, see Vagrakkhedika XV; or 'following the lower
  Dharma.' </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">82. [a timely birth] Of the hearer; so that the student should be born at a time when
  there is a Buddha on earth. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">83. [Sravaka] Those who are as yet hearers only of the Dharma.
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">84. [Anekabuddhas] Should it be Pratyekabuddhas?
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">85. [a learned man of an intelligent race] The text is evidently corrupt, and the
  translation conjectural. </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">86. [...the object (of faith)] The tenth verse is again unintelligible, but may have
  meant something like that 'those who having heard the best Laws, are joyful in remembering
  Sugata, are our friends in time past, and they also who whish for enlightenment.'
  </FONT> </p>
  <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">87. [Anagamin] One who is not born again, except in the Brahma world, and then may
  obtain Nirvana. </FONT> </p>
